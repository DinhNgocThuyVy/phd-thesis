Path analysis is a complex regression analysis with a direct or indirect causal relationship between several variables. The data used in this research is simulation data. The path analysis model formed consists of two correlated exogenous variables, one endogenous variable and one intermediate variable with the relationship between variables used limited to linear form. The results of this study indicate that the WLS parameter estimation method is better than the OLS method in estimating the path analysis parameters that have heteroscedasticity problems. The parameter estimator between the two methods has no significant difference, but the standard error of the WLS method is smaller than that of the OLS. In line with this, the p-value of the significance of the WLS method parameters was almost entirely significant for the five relationships at various levels of heteroscedasticity. it can also be concluded that the larger the sample size, the smaller the standard error for both the OLS and WLS methods. The model's goodness from the adjusted value of the WLS method is higher than the adjusted value of the OLS method.},

Samples were analyzed for the molecular composition of dicarboxylic acids, ketoacids, α-dicarbonyls, and sugars, together with water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC) and inorganic ions. Based on the analyses of backward trajectories and chemical tracers, we found that during the campaign, air masses arrived from Siberia (a biomass burning source region) on 8-9 August, from China (an anthropogenic source region) on 9-10 August, and from the East China Sea/Sea of Japan (a mixed source receptor region) on 10-11 August. Most of the diacids, ketoacids, dicarbonyls, levoglucosan, WSOC, and inorganic ions (i.e., SO2-3, NH+4 and K+) were enriched in fine particles (PM1.1) whereas Ca2+, Mg2+ and Cl- peaked in coarse sizes ({$>$}1.1 μm). Interestingly, OC, most sugar compounds and NO-3 showed bimodal distributions in fine and coarse modes. In PM1.1, diacids in biomass burning-influenced aerosols transported from Siberia (mean: 252 ng mg -3) were more abundant than those in the aerosols originating from China (209 ng mg-3) and ocean (142 ng mg-3), whereas SO2-4 concentrations were highest in the aerosols from China (mean: 3970 ng mg-3) followed by marine-(2950 ng mg -3) and biomass burning-influenced (1980 ng mg-3) aerosols. Higher loadings of WSOC (2430 ng mg-3) and OC (4360 ng mg-3) were found in the fine mode, where biomass-burning products such as levoglucosan are abundant. This paper presents a case study of long-range transported aerosols illustrating that biomass burning episodes in the Siberian region have a significant influence on the chemical composition of carbonaceous aerosols in the western North Pacific rim. © 2010 ESO.},

The mean concentrations of each fraction measured for the entire study period were found to be 26.6±2.59, 54.0±15.0, and 75.3±16.6μgm-3, respectively. The seasonal mean of PM2.5 varied in the range of 22.9±7.10 (fall) to 30.2±7.58μgm-3 (winter). In contrast, PM10 and TSP showed a summer minimum (40.1±12.6 and 55.6±17.8μgm-3, respectively) and a spring maximum (67.1±16.7 and 93.7±21.1μgm-3, respectively). The contribution of regional or long-range transport to the observed PM levels in the study area, if estimated by comparison to the data of the regional background area, was found to explain up to 72\% of its input. The long-term trend of PM indicated a gradual decreasing pattern over a 10 year period, although that of PM2.5 was rather complicated to interpret in the recent years. The overall results of our study nonetheless confirm the potent role of legislation efforts put consistently to improve the air quality through the years.},

  abstract = {The composition of airborne particulate matter (PM) varies widely depending on its source, and recent studies have suggested that particle-associated adverse health effects are related to particle composition. The objective of this study was to compare the biological/toxicological effects of different source-related PM. Specifically, we investigated the biological/toxicological effects of standard reference materials (SRMs): non-ferrous dust (PD-1, industrial), urban PM (UPM, SRM1648a), and diesel PM (DPM, SRM2975), and ambient PM2.5 (PM with an aerodynamic diameter {$<$}2.5 m) collected at an urban site (Toronto, Canada). The dithiothreitol assay was used to measure the redox activity of the particles. Human alveolar epithelial cells (A549) were exposed to a range of concentrations (10 1000μ g/ml) of total PM, and the respective water-soluble and insoluble fractions, for 24h. Biological responses were then evaluated in terms of cytotoxicity and interleukin (IL)-8 release, and compared with the PM composition and redox activity. We demonstrated that transition metal-enriched PD-1 exhibited the greatest cytotoxic effect (LD 50 values of 100 400μ g/ml vs. {$>$}1000 μg/ml for the SRM1648a, SRM2975, and ambient PM2.5). Similarly, the PM-induced release of IL-8 was greatest for PD-1 (∼69ng/ml vs. ∼1.53ng/ml for others). These endpoints were more responsive to metals as compared with compared with secondary inorganic ions and organic compounds. Interestingly, we demonstrated a high degree of adsorption of IL-8 to the various SRMs and ambient PM 2.5, and subsequently derived a new correction method to aid in interpretation of these data. These characteristics likely impart differential effects toward the toxic and immune effects of PM. © 2010 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.},

  abstract = {A chemical reaction chamber system has been developed for the processing of oleic acid aerosol particles with ozone under two relative humidity conditions: dry and humidified to 65 \%. The apparatus consists of an aerosol flow tube, in which the ozonolysis occurs, coupled to a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) and an aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ATOFMS) which measure the evolving particle size and composition. Under both relative humidity conditions, ozonolysis results in a significant decrease in particle size and mass which is consistent with the formation of volatile products that partition from the particle to the gas phase. Mass spectra derived from the ATOFMS reveal the presence of the typically observed reaction products: azelaic acid, nonanal, oxononanoic acid and nonanoic acid, as well as a range of higher molecular weight products deriving from the reactions of reaction intermediates with oleic acid and its oxidation products. These include octanoic acid and 9- and 10-oxooctadecanoic acid, as well as products of considerably higher molecular weight. Quantitative evaluation of product yields with the ATOFMS shows a marked dependence upon both particle size association (from 0.3 to 2.1 µm diameter) and relative humidity. Under both relative humidity conditions, the percentage residual of oleic acid increases with increasing particle size and the main lower molecular weight products are nonanal and oxononanoic acid. Under dry conditions, the percentage of higher molecular weight products increases with increasing particle size due to the poorer internal mixing of the larger particles. Under humidified conditions, the percentage of unreacted oleic acid is greater, except in the smallest particle fraction, with little formation of high molecular weight products relative to the dry particles.},

Oxidation by O               3               imparts a large Δ               17               O signature to the resulting sulfate (8.8‰) relative to oxidation by H               2               O               2               (0.9‰) or by OH or O               2               (0‰). Ship data from two Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX) cruises in the Indian Ocean indicate Δ               17               O values usually {$<$}1‰ in the submicron sulfate aerosol but considerable variability in the supermicron sulfate with frequent occurrences above 1‰ and up to 6.7‰. The large Δ               17               O values are associated with high concentrations of sea‐salt aerosols, providing evidence for the S(IV) + O               3               pathway. We use a global chemical transport model (GEOS‐CHEM) to interpret quantitatively the INDOEX observations and to assess the global importance of sulfate production in sea‐salt aerosols. The model accounts for titration of sea‐salt alkalinity in the MBL by uptake of acid gases (SO               2               , H               2               SO               4               , and HNO               3               ), shutting down the S(IV) + O               3               pathway. We find that this titration occurs rapidly over much of the oceans except at high latitudes (strong sea‐salt emission) and is due to both the S(IV) + O               3               reaction and HNO               3               (g) condensation; that is, sulfate formation in sea‐salt aerosols is limited by the alkalinity flux from the ocean and by competition for this alkalinity supply from HNO               3               (g). The model is consistent with the Δ               17               O magnitudes and patterns in the INDOEX data. Titration of alkalinity is critical for the success of the model simulation. Regeneration of sea‐salt aerosol alkalinity by OH uptake is inconsistent with the Δ               17               O observations in INDOEX. Model results indicate that sulfate production in sea‐salt aerosols decreases MBL SO               2               concentrations and gas phase H               2               SO               4               production rates by typically 10–30\% (up to {$>$}70\%) and increases MBL sulfate concentrations by typically {$>$}10\% (up to 30\%). Globally, this mechanism contributes 9\% of atmospheric sulfate production and 1\% of the sulfate burden. The impact on H               2               SO               4               (g) formation and implications for the potential formation of new particles in the MBL warrants inclusion in models examining the radiative effects of sulfate aerosols.},

  abstract = {Understanding fine particulate matter (PM2.5) composition and sources is beneficial to improving visibility, addressing climate change, and mitigating poor air quality and related public health effects. Source apportionment techniques have been instrumental in evaluating the impact of sources and secondary processes on the ambient PM2.5 concentrations in receptor areas. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) is now the most commonly used tool due to its ability to provide mixture resolution based on available PM2.5 compositional data. Sampling and analysis of PM2.5 was conducted in Cape Town, South Africa from April 2017 to April 2018. The resulting data were dispersion normalized to address the modifications of the source concentrations resulting from the varying dispersion conditions and thereby permit dispersion normalized PMF (DN-PMF) to be employed. DNPMF quantified the 6 sources as 2-stroke vehicles/galvanizing industries (16.8\%); soil/road dust (12.3\%); sulphate/marine diesel (3.6\%), traffic (15.7\%), sea salt (21.8\%), and heating/biomass burning/cooking (15.7\%). In addition, air mass back trajectory analysis using the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model identified long-range transport pathways to Cape Town. The HYSPLIT results showed air masses from the Atlantic SSW (6\%), Atlantic SW (24\%), Indian Ocean (31\%), and Atlantic WSW (39\%) influence air quality. The primary sources affected by the transport clusters were heating, 2-stroke vehicles/galvanizing, road and soil dust, and traffic emissions.

  abstract = {The current study was designed to assess the association between temporal variations in urban PM2.5 chemical composition, sources, and the oxidative stress and inflammatory response in an alveolar macrophage (AM) model. A year-long sampling campaign collected PM2.5 samples at the Sharif University in Tehran, Iran. PMinduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was measured both with an acellular dithiothreitol consumption assay (DTT-ROS; ranged from 2.1 to 9.3 nmoles min−1 m−3) and an in vitro macrophage-mediated ROS production assay (AM-ROS; ranged from 125 to 1213 μg Zymosan equivalents m−3). The production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α; ranged from \textasciitilde 60 to 518 pg TNF-α m−3) was quantified as a marker of the inflammatory potential of the PM. PM-induced DTT-ROS and AM-ROS were substantially higher for the colder months' PM (1.5-fold \& 3-fold, respectively) compared with warm season. Vehicular emission tracers, aliphatic diacids, and hopanes exhibited moderate correlation with ROS measures. TNF-α secretion exhibited a markedly different pattern than ROS activity with a 2-fold increase in the warm months compared to the rest of the year. Gasoline vehicles and residual oil combustion were moderately associated with both ROS measures (R ≥ 0.67, p {$<$} 0.05), while diesel vehicles exhibited a strong correlation with secreted TNF-α in the cold season (R = 0.89, p {$<$} 0.05). mRNA expression of fourteen genes including antioxidant response and pro-inflammatory markers were found to be differentially modulated in our AM model. HMOX1, an antioxidant response gene, was up-regulated throughout the year. Pro-inflammatory genes (e.g. TNF-α and IL1β) were down-regulated in the cold season and displayed moderate to weak correlation with crustal elements (R {$>$} 0.5, p {$<$} 0.05). AM-ROS activity showed an inverse relationship with genes including SOD2, TNF, IL1β and IL6 (R ≥ −0.66, p {$<$} 0.01). Our findings indicate that Tehran's PM2.5 has the potential to induce oxidative stress and inflammation responses in vitro. In the current study, these responses included NRF2, NF-κB and MAPK pathways.},

  abstract = {A total of 32 atmospheric depositions (ADs) samples were collected from eight sampling sites from April 2018 to March 2019 in the Tehran megacity. Elemental concentration, pollution characteristics, ecological and human health risks, and source apportionment of ADs in the {$<$} 63 μm fraction were investigated. Descriptive statistical analysis revealed that the average concentration of Zn, Cd, Pb, and Cu had the highest values over the upper continental crust (UCC). The influence of anthropogenic activities on the level of elements pollution was determined using the Geo-accumulation index (Igeo), Enrichment factor (EF), and Pollution index (PI). The findings revealed the highest Igeo values for Cd at the “extremely contaminated” level due to great influence from Cd emission sources, especially in spring. The extremely high EF values for Zn in 18.8\% of samples could be attributed to the low distance of these sampling sites from the nearby industrial areas and adjacent road traffic density. PI values in the range of “considerable to extremely high” pollution were in the order of Zn {$>$} Cd {$>$} Pb {$>$} Cu {$>$} Ni {$>$} Cr. Eventually, The pollution load index (PLI) indicated the higher than unity of PLI values for all sampling sites reflecting considerable polluted sites across the study area. The ecological risk index (RI) indicated a considerable ecological risk, with the highest monomial risk values for Cd and Pb. The cumulative hazard index (HI) results showed that children encounter higher non-carcinogenic (NCR) risks than adults. However, the cumulative carcinogenic risk (CCR) of adults was 2.25 times higher than for children. The positive matrix factorization (PMF) model extracted four factors, including traffic-related sources (29.7\%), local soils and crustal dust resuspension sources (24.8\%), demolition and construction activities (23.5\%), and industry-related emissions (22\%). Among the identified sources, traffic-related sources showed the largest contribution to elements and ecological risks.},

  abstract = {Fine particulate matter, with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5), is a severe problem in China. The lack of ground-based measurements and its sparse distribution obstruct long-term air pollution impact studies over China. Therefore, the present study used newly updated Global Estimates (V5. GL.02) of monthly PM2.5 data from 2001 to 2020 based on Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) by Washington University. The GWR PM2.5 data were validated against ground-based measurements from 2014 to 2020, and the validation results demonstrated a good agreement between GWR and ground-based PM2.5 with a higher correlation (r = 0.95), lower error (8.14), and lower bias (−3.10 \%). The long-term (2001−2020) PM2.5 data were used to identify pollution hotspots and sources across China using the potential source contribution function (PSCF). The results showed highly significant PM2.5 pollution hotspots in central (Henan, Hubei), North China Plain (NCP), northwest (Taklimakan), and Sichuan Basin (Chongqing, Sichuan) in China, with the most severe pollution occurring in winter compared to other seasons. During the winter, PM2.5 was in the range from 6.08 to 93.05 μg/m3 in 33 provinces, which is 1.22 to 18.61 times higher than the World Health Organization (WHO) Air Quality Guidelines (AQG-2021; annual mean: 5 μg/m3). In 26 provinces, the reported PM2.5 was 1.07 to 2.66 times higher than the Chinese Ambient Air Quality Standard (AAQS; annual mean: 35 μg/m3). Furthermore, provincial-level trend analysis shows that in most Chinese provinces, PM2.5 increased significantly (3–43 \%) from 2001 to 2012, whereas it decreased by 12–94 \% from 2013 to 2020 due to the implementation of air pollution control policies. Finally, the PSCF analysis demonstrates that China's air quality is mainly affected by local PM2.5 sources rather than by pollutants imported from outside China.},

The objective was to identify the possible sources of PM10 aerosols, their respective chemical tracers and to determine their relative contribution at the sampling site.PM10 particles samples were collected from June 2003 to March 2005 in order to analyse up to 35 elements (Ag, Al, As, Ba, Bi, Ca, Cd, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Eu, Fe, K, La, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, Pb, Rb, S, Sb, Sc, Si, Sm, Sr, Th, Ti, U, V, Zn and Zr) using Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP)-Atomic Emission Spectrometry (AES) and ICP-Mass Spectrometry (MS). A significant effort has been made on estimating the total uncertainty of each result by regularly analysing blanks, quality controls and SRM NIST standards. Based on this procedure, a selected set of 24 "robust" elements was compared to the 35-element matrix in order to evaluate the sturdiness of our PMF statistical treatment.Eight source factors were resolved by PCA for all the wind sectors explaining 90\% of the total data variance. The PMF results confirmed that eight physically interpretable factors contributed to the ambient particulate pollution at the sampling site: crustal dust (11\%), marine aerosols (12\%), petrochemistry activities (9.2\%), metallurgical sintering plant (8.6\%), metallurgical coke plant (12.6\%), ferromanganese plant (6.6\%), road transport (15\%) and a less clearly interpretable profile probably associated to dust resuspension (13\%). These weighted contributions against wind direction frequencies demonstrate that industrial sources are the most important contributors to this site (37\%) followed by the natural sources (detrital and marine sources) (23\%) and the road transport (15\%). © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {This work presents the results of a PM2.5 source apportionment study conducted in urban background sites from 16 European and Asian countries. For some Eastern Europe and Central Asia cities this was the first time that quantitative information on pollution source contributions to ambient particulate matter (PM) has been performed. More than 2200 filters were sampled and analyzed by X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), Particle-Induced X-Ray Emission (PIXE), and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICPMS) to measure the concentrations of chemical elements in fine particles. Samples were also analyzed for the contents of black carbon, elemental carbon, organic carbon, and water-soluble ions. The Positive Matrix Factorization receptor model (EPA PMF 5.0) was used to characterize similarities and heterogeneities in PM2.5 sources and respective contributions in the cities that the number of collected samples exceeded 75. At the end source apportionment was performed in 11 out of the 16 participating cities. Nine major sources were identified to have contributed to PM2.5: biomass burning, secondary sulfates, traffic, fuel oil combustion, industry, coal combustion, soil, salt and “other sources”. From the averages of sources contributions, considering 11 cities 16\% of PM2.5 was attributed to biomass burning, 15\% to secondary sulfates, 13\% to traffic, 12\% to soil, 8.0\% to fuel oil combustion, 5.5\% to coal combustion, 1.9\% to salt, 0.8\% to industry emissions, 5.1\% to “other sources” and 23\% to unaccounted mass. Characteristic seasonal patterns were identified for each PM2.5 source. Biomass burning in all cities, coal combustion in Krakow/POL, and oil combustion in Belgrade/SRB and Banja Luka/BIH increased in Winter due to the impact of domestic heating, whereas in most cities secondary sulfates reached higher levels in Summer as a consequence of the enhanced photochemical activity. During high pollution days the largest sources of fine particles were biomass burning, traffic and secondary sulfates.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric particulate matter (PM) is known to be harmful to human and environmental health, with factors including particle size and composition thought to be key drivers of toxicity. Understanding the composition and hence sources of PM is critical to distinguish between anthropogenic and natural impacts, and develop the most efficient air pollution mitigation policies. This distinction is particularly important in areas affected by dust storm activity from nearby arid regions, which may dominate long-term PM mass concentrations. In this work, 24-hour PM2.5 samples were collected from two locations in Dammam city, Saudi Arabia during the winter and summer of 2018, and subjected to detailed analysis to assess the PM characteristics and sources. Offline chemical analysis of the samples utilied ICP/MS, ion chromatography and thermal decomposition for measurement of trace metals, ions and OC/EC concentrations, respectively. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) analyses were used to identify sources of PM2.5 in Dammam. The mean PM2.5 mass concentration in the summer was twice that in the winter at both locations, and crustal and secondary inorganic aerosol components dominated over other species in determining PM2.5 mass concentrations at both seasons and locations. The PMF analysis identified six source factors, including crustal, nitrate-rich, sea salt, sulfate-rich, biomass burning and traffic sources. In addition, the impact of dust storms on PM2.5 concentrations was analysed. Dust storms increased the 24-hour average concentration of PM2.5 by three-fold, and that of crustal elements by five-fold while the impact of dust storms on components identified as anthropogenic in origin was limited. Overall, dust-storm activity accounted for 42\% of PM2.5 mass concentration; after accounting for this aspect, secondary inorganic components derived largely from primary pollutant emissions dominated the remaining PM2.5 mass.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric PM pollution from traffic comprises not only direct emissions but also non-exhaust emissions because resuspension of road dust that can produce high human exposure to heavy metals, metalloids, and mineral matter. A key task for establishing mitigation or preventive measures is estimating the contribution of road dust resuspension to the atmospheric PM mixture. Several source apportionment studies, applying receptor modeling at urban background sites, have shown the difficulty in identifying a road dust source separately from other mineral sources or vehicular exhausts. The Multilinear Engine (ME-2) is a computer program that can solve the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) problem. ME-2 uses a programming language permitting the solution to be guided toward some possible targets that can be derived from a priori knowledge of sources (chemical profile, ratios, etc.). This feature makes it especially suitable for source apportionment studies where partial knowledge of the sources is available. In the present study ME-2 was applied to data from an urban background site of Barcelona (Spain) to quantify the contribution of road dust resuspension to PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations. Given that recently the emission profile of local resuspended road dust was obtained (Amato, F., Pandolfi, M., Viana, M., Querol, X., Alastuey, A., Moreno, T., 2009. Spatial and chemical patterns of PM10 in road dust deposited in urban environment. Atmospheric Environment 43 (9), 1650-1659), such a priori information was introduced in the model as auxiliary terms of the object function to be minimized by the implementation of the so-called "pulling equations". ME-2 permitted to enhance the basic PMF solution (obtained by PMF2) identifying, beside the seven sources of PMF2, the road dust source which accounted for 6.9 μg m-3 (17\%) in PM10, 2.2 μg m-3 (8\%) of PM2.5 and 0.3 μg m-3 (2\%) of PM1. This reveals that resuspension was responsible of the 37\%, 15\% and 3\% of total traffic emissions respectively in PM10, PM2.5 and PM1. Therefore the overall traffic contribution resulted in 18 μg m-3 (46\%) in PM10, 14 μg m-3 (51\%) in PM2.5 and 8 μg m-3 (48\%) in PM1. In PMF2 this mass explained by road dust resuspension was redistributed among the rest of sources, increasing mostly the mineral, secondary nitrate and aged sea salt contributions. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Recent research interest has been focused on road dust resuspension as one of the major sources of atmospheric particulate matter in an urban environment. Given the dearth of studies on the variability of the PM10 fraction of road deposited sediments, our understanding of the main factors controlling this pollutant is incomplete. In the present study a new sampling methodology was devised and applied to collect PM10 deposited mass from 1 m2 of road pavement. PM10 road dust fraction was sampled directly from active traffic lanes at 23 sampling sites during a campaign in Barcelona (Spain) in June 2007. The aim of the study was to gain more insight into the variability of mass and chemistry of road dust in different urban environments, such as the city centre, ring roads, and locations nearby demolition/construction sites. The city centre showed values of PM10 road dust within a range of 3-23 mg m-2, whereas levels reached 24-80 mg m-2 in locations affected by transport of uncovered heavy trucks. The largest dust loads were measured in the proximity of demolition/construction sites and the harbor entry with values up to 328 mg m-2. The city centre road dust profiles (\%) were enriched in OC, EC, Fe, S, Cu, Zn, Mn, Cr, Sb, Sn, Mo, Zr, Hf, Ge, Ba, Pb, Bi, SO42-, NO3-, Cl- and NH4+, but several crustal components such as Ca, Ti, Na, and Mg were also considerably concentrated. Locations affected by construction and demolition activities had high levels of crustal components such as Ca, Li, Sc, Sr, Rb and also As whereas ring roads, characterized by a higher load of uncovered heavy trucks showed an intermediate composition. Levels of PM10 components per area were also evaluated to quantify the resuspendable amount of each element from 1 m2. In the inner city environment mean values of 1363 μg Ca m-2, 816 μg OC m-2, 239 μg EC m-2, 13 μg Cu m-2, 12 μg Zn m-2, 1.9 μg Sb m-2 and 2.0 μg Pb m-2, in PM10 in all cases, were registered. Moreover the deposited PM load at demolition/construction sites acts as a reservoir or trap for traffic-related particles, which gives rise to large amounts of hazardous pollutants, available for resuspension. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Despite their importance, current scientific knowledge on non-exhaust emissions by road traffic is scarce, severely hampering a reliable description of these particles in atmospheric dispersion models. Consequently, it is still very difficult to convincingly evaluate population exposure to traffic-related components in large cities, especially given the significant variation in traffic-related air pollution concentrations on a small scale (e.g. within 100e1000 m of a busy road). One factor contributing to this uncertainty is the lack of a reliable emission estimate for vehicular non-exhaust emissions. Emissions vary from location to location due to the impact of climate, road surface characteristics and traffic conditions, but the geographical coverage for which Emission Factors are available and the amount of knowledge regarding the variability within a city environment are very limited.},

Simultaneous data from one urban background (UB), one traffic (T) and one heavy traffic (HT) location were analysed, and roadside PM10 enrichments (RE) in a number of elements arising from vehicular emissions were calculated. Tracers of primary traffic emissions (EC, Fe, Ba, Cu, Sb, Cr, Sn) showed the largest REs ({$>$}70\%). Other traffic tracers (Zr, Cd) showed lower but still consistent REs (25–40\%), similar to those obtained for mineral matter resulting from road dust resuspension (Ca, La, Ce, Ti, Ga, Sr, 30–40\%). The sum of primary and secondary organic carbon showed a RE of 41\%, with contributions of secondary OC (SOC) to total OC ranging from 46\% at the HT site, 63\% at the T site, and 78\% in the UB. Finally, other trace elements (As, Co, Bi) showed unexpected but consistent roadside enrichments (23\% up to 69\%), suggesting a link to traffic emissions even though the emission process is unclear.},

When it can be reasonably expected that the sites are affected by the same set of sources, it is possible to use the spatial variability of the source contributions to enhance the source apportionment. With the framework of positive matrix factorization, it is possible to enhance the results through an effective use of multiple site data. There have been several previous studies of the sources of ambient PM2.5 in St Louis, MO based on data from the US EPA chemical speciation network and the St Louis-Midwest Supersite. However, these different analyses identified different sets of sources including the omission of known major emission sources. A re-examination of the previous studies was undertaken using knowledge of the existing sources based on independent data and the resulting profiles were used to constrain the solution. These new solutions provide more realistic results in which the source impacts of all of the major sources could be assessed at each site. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Results indicate that road dust increased PM10 levels on average by 21-35\% at traffic sites, 29-34\% at urban background sites heavily affected by road traffic emissions, 17-22\% at urban-industrial sites and 9-22\% at rural sites. Road dust contributions to ambient PM levels show a marked seasonality with maxima in summer and minima in winter, likely due to the rainfall frequency. Decreasing concentration trends over the sampling years were found at some traffic and urban sites but in most cases the decreases were less significant than for vehicle exhaust emissions, while concentrations increased at industrial sites, probably due to local peculiarities. Concerning PM2.5, road dust contributions were lower than in PM10, as expected but still important (21-31\%, 11-31\%, 6-16\% and 7\% for traffic, urban background, urban-industrial and rural sites, respectively). In addition the three main sources of road dust (carbonaceous particles, brake wear and road wear/mineral) were identified and their contributions to road dust mass loadings estimated, supporting the idea that air quality managers should drive measures aimed at preventing the build-up of road dust particles on roads. © 2014 Author(s).}

  abstract = {For a Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) aerosol source apportionment (SA) studies there is no standard procedure to select the most appropriate chemical components to be included in the input dataset for a given site typology, nor specific recommendations in this direction. However, these choices are crucial for the final SA outputs not only in terms of number of sources identified but also, and consequently, in the source contributions estimates. In fact, PMF tends to reproduce most of PM mass measured independently and introduced as a total variable in the input data, regardless of the percentage of PM mass which has been chemically characterized, so that the lack of some specific source tracers (e.g. levoglucosan) can potentially affect the results of the whole source apportionment study. The present study elaborates further on the same concept, evaluating quantitatively the impact of lacking specific sources’ tracers on the whole source apportionment, both in terms of identified sources and source contributions. This work aims to provide first recommendations on the most suitable and critical components to be included in PMF analyses in order to reduce PMF output uncertainty as much as possible, and better represent the most commons PM sources observed in many sites in Western countries. To this aim, we performed three sensitivity analyses on three different datasets across EU, including extended sets of organic tracers, in order to cover different types of urban conditions (Mediterranean, Continental, and Alpine), source types, and PM fractions. Our findings reveal that the vehicle exhaust source resulted to be less sensitive to the choice of analytes, although source contributions estimates can deviate significantly up to 44 \%. On the other hand, for the detection of the non-exhaust one is clearly necessary to analyze specific inorganic elements. The choice of not analysing non-polar organics likely causes the loss of separation of exhaust and non-exhaust factors, thus obtaining a unique road traffic source, which provokes a significant bias of total contribution. Levoglucosan was, in most cases, crucial to identify biomass burning contributions in Milan and in Barcelona, in spite of the presence of PAHs in Barcelona, while for the case of Grenoble, even discarding levoglucosan, the presence of PAHs allowed identifying the BB factor. Modifying the rest of analytes provoke a systematic underestimation of biomass burning source contributions. SIA factors resulted to be generally overestimated with respect to the base case analysis, also in the case that ions were not included in the PMF analysis. Trace elements were crucial to identify shipping emissions (V and Ni) and industrial sources (Pb, Ni, Br, Zn, Mn, Cd and As). When changing the rest of input variables, the uncertainty was narrow for shipping but large for industrial processes. Major and trace elements were also crucial to identify the mineral/soil factor at all cities. Biogenic SOA and Anthropogenic SOA factors were sensitive to the presence of their molecular tracers, since the availability of OC alone is unable to separate a SOA factor. Arabitol and sorbitol were crucial to detecting fungal spores while odd number of higher alkanes (C27 to C31) for plant debris.},

These samples were used to investigate sources of PM10 and PM2.5, and to evaluate longterm trends in PM10 and BC concentrations. Five PM10 and PM2.5 sources were identified using positive matrix factorization: biomass combustion, motor vehicles, secondary sulfate, marine aerosol and soil. Overall, biomass combustion was the dominant contributor to PM10 (48\%) and PM2.5 (77\%) mass. The biomass combustion factor profile featured arsenic, suggesting that locals were burning copper chrome arsenate-treated timber, an activity that appears to occur throughout New Zealand. Trend analyses on PM10 and black carbon concentrations revealed that both were decreasing year-onyear, at an average rate of 0.5 mg m–3 per year and 100 ng m–3 per year, respectively. This study provides important information for Nelson City Council, who are responsible for managing air quality in Nelson, to effectively manage air quality. This study also shows that relatively simple mitigation measures can instigate decreases in PM and BC concentrations.},

Increasing biodiesel concentration in the fuel blend decreased all PAH compounds, and those with 3 and 5 aromatic rings were the most abundant. Palm biodiesel affected both OPAA and ecotoxicity. While B10 and B20 exhibited the same rate of ascorbic acid (AA) depletion, B100 showed significant faster oxidation rate during the first four minutes and oxidized 10\% more AA at the end of the test. B100 and B20 were significantly more ecotoxic than B10. The lethal concentration LC50 for B10 was 6.13 mg/L.

Most of the training received by social scientists with respect to homoskedasticity is limited to graphical displays for detection and data transformations as solution, giving little recourse if none of these two approaches work. Borrowing from the econometrics literature, this tutorial aims to present a clear description of what heteroskedasticity is, how to measure it through statistical tests designed for it and how to address it through the use of heteroskedastic-consistent standard errors and the wild bootstrap.

Methods: Daily concentrations of particle mass (PM10, PM2 5, and PM10\_2 5), measured using gravimetric, tapered-element-oscillating, and filter-dynamic-measurement-system samplers, as well as parti cle number concentration and particle composition (carbon, sulfate, nitrate and chloride), were collected from a background monitoring station in central London between 2000 and 2005.

  abstract = {Background: Particulate matter (PM) from traffic and other sources has been associated with adverse health effects. One unifying theory is that PM, whatever its source, acts on the human body via its capacity to cause damaging oxidation reactions related to its content of pro-oxidants components. Few epidemiological studies have investigated particle oxidative potential (OP) and health. We conducted a time series analysis to assess associations between daily particle OP measures and numbers of deaths and hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Methods: During 2011 and 2012 particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 and 10 m (PM2.5 and PM10 respectively) were collected daily on Partisol filters located at an urban background monitoring station in Central London. Particulate OP was assessed based on the capacity of the particles to oxidize ascorbate (OPAA) and glutathione (OPGSH) from a simple chemical model reflecting the antioxidant composition of human respiratory tract lining fluid. Particulate OP, expressed as \% loss of antioxidant per g of PM, was then multiplied by the daily concentrations of PM to derive the daily OP of PM mass concentrations (\% loss per m3). Daily numbers of deaths and age- and cause-specific hospital admissions in London were obtained from national registries. Poisson regression accounting for seasonality and meteorology was used to estimate the percentage change in risk of death or admission associated with an interquartile increment in particle OP. Results: We found little evidence for adverse associations between OPAA and OPGSH and mortality. Associations with cardiovascular admissions were generally positive in younger adults and negative in older adults with confidence intervals including 0\%. For respiratory admissions there was a trend, from positive to negative associations, with increasing age although confidence intervals generally included 0\%. Conclusions: Our study, the first to analyse daily particle OP measures and mortality and admissions in a large population over two years, found little evidence to support the hypothesis that short-term exposure to particle OP is associated with adverse health effects. Further studies with improved exposure assessment and longer time series are required to confirm or reject the role of particle OP in triggering exacerbations of disease.},

  abstract = {Daily PM10 samples were collected at two urban sites within two valleys in the French Alps (Chamonix and St Jean de Maurienne) during a period of two and a half years. The carbonaceous species EC (elemental carbon) and OC (organic carbon) were analysed to investigate the possible sources of EC and OC, and their seasonal variations. Mean OC concentrations are in the very high range of concentrations measured for other European sites, and represent at least one third of the PM10 mass on each site. On the basis of the comparison between EC and OC concentrations with several tracers, we were able to show that their main sources are local primary combustion sources. Biomass burning emissions (residential heating) have a significant impact on OC concentrations while heavy duty traffic emissions have an impact only on EC concentrations. Finally, we estimated the contribution of SOA (secondary organic carbon) to OC, using the EC-to-OC primary ratio method (Castro et al., 1999) and demonstrated that the calculation of SOA mass with this method is highly uncertain, if the hypothesis of a constant primary EC-to-OC ratio is not very closely examined.},

In vitro cell challenges were preferable to in vitro acellular systems but both have a potential major role to play and offer large cost advantages relative to human or animal inhalation studies and animal in vivo installation experiments.

It would be necessary to standardize an analytical method that could be easily and routinely used for HULIS measurements. We present one of the first comparisons of two of the main methods in use to extract HULIS, using I) a weak anion exchanger (DEAE) and II) the combination of two separation steps, one according to polarity (on C18) and the second according to acidity (with a strong anion exchanger SAX). The quantification is performed with a TOC analyzer, complemented by an investigation of the chemical structure of the extracted fractions by UV-Visible spectroscopy. The analytical performances of each method are determined and compared for humic substances standards. These methods are further applied to determine the water extractable HULIS (HULISWS) and the 0.1 M NaOH alkaline extractable HULIS (HULIST) in atmospheric aerosol collected in an Alpine Valley during winter time. This comparison, although on a limited batch of samples shows that the simpler DEAE isolation procedure leads to higher recoveries and better reproducibility than the C18-SAX procedure, and might therefore be preferable.},

  abstract = {Many atmospheric aerosols seem to contain strong organic surfactants likely to enhance their cloud-forming properties. Yet, few techniques allow for the identification and characterization of these compounds. Recently, we introduced a double extraction method to isolate the surfactant fraction of atmospheric aerosol samples, and evidenced their very low surface tension (≤30mNm -1). In this work, this analytical procedure was further optimized. In addition to an optimized extraction and a reduction of the analytical time, the improved method led to a high reproducibility in the surface tension curves obtained (shapes and minimal values), illustrated by the low uncertainties on the values, ±10\% or less. The improved method was applied to PM 10 aerosols from the urban area of Grenoble, France collected from June 2009 to January 2010. Significant variability was observed between the samples. The minimum surface tension obtained from the summer samples was systematically lower (30mNm -1) than that of the winter samples (35-45mNm -1). Sharp transitions in the curves together with the very low surface tensions suggested that the dominating surfactants in the summer samples were biosurfactants, which would be consistent with the high biogenic activity in that season. One group of samples from the winter also displayed sharp transitions, which, together with the slightly higher surface tension, suggested the presence of weaker, possibly man-made, surfactants. A second group of curves from the winter did not display any clear transition but were similar to those of macromolecular surfactants such as polysaccharides or humic substances from wood burning. These surfactants are thus likely to originate from wood burning, the dominating source for aerosols in Grenoble in winter. These observations thus confirm the presence of surfactants from combustion processes in urban aerosols reported by other groups and illustrates the ability of our method to distinguish between different types of surfactants in atmospheric samples. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Positive matrix factorization (PMF) was used to assess apportionment of trace elements between three unique sources, which were identified as proxies of carbonate dust, aluminous dust, and sea salt. The three PMF factors agree well with literature values and represent the first time carbonate and aluminous dust sources have been quantifiably differentiated using high-resolution glaciochemistry. The concentrations of all three sources varied with ice core site. However, the large array of ice cores provided a regional-scale understanding of the sources and magnitude of dust and sea salt impurities deposited on the Greenland ice sheet. At the regional level, all three sources varied on seasonal, annual, and multiyear timescales. The seasonal deposition of sea salt impurities reached a maximum in the winter, followed by spring peaks of carbonate and aluminous dust. Over the 331 year composite record, only aluminous dust exhibited a longterm increasing trend that peaked in the 1930s and was followed by a 20\% decline in recent decades.

Although oxidative stress-induced airway inflammation is one of the main adverse outcome pathways triggered by air pollution-derived PM, the persistence of both these underlying mechanisms, even after exposure cessation, remained poorly studied. In this study, A/JOlaHsd mice were also exposed acutely (24 h) or sub-chronically (4 weeks), with or without a recovery period (12 weeks), to two urban PM2.5 samples collected during contrasting seasons (i.e., autumn/winter, AW or spring/summer, SS). The distinct intrinsic oxidative potentials (OPs) of AW and SS PM2.5, as evaluated in acellular conditions, were closely related to their respective physicochemical characteristics and their respective ability to really generate ROS over-production in the mouse lungs. Despite the early activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) cell signaling pathway by AW and, in a lesser degree, SS PM2.5, in the murine lungs after acute and sub-chronic exposures, the critical redox homeostasis was not restored, even after the exposure cessation. Accordingly, an inflammatory response was reported through the activation of the nuclear factorkappa B (NF-κB) cell signaling pathway activation, the secretion of cytokines, and the recruitment of inflammatory cells, in the murine lungs after the acute and sub-chronic exposures to AW and, in a lesser extent, to SS PM2.5, which persisted after the recovery period. Taken together, these original results provided, for the first time, new relevant insights that air pollution-derived PM2.5, with relatively high intrinsic OPs, induced oxidative stress and inflammation, which persisted admittedly at a lower level in the lungs after the exposure cessation, thereby contributing to the occurrence of molecular and cellular adverse events leading to the development and/ or exacerbation of future chronic inflammatory lung diseases and even cancers.},

  abstract = {Tapado Glacier is a subtropical mountain glacier in the Coquimbo region of Chile that has been continuously retreating during the last 60 years due to diminishing precipitation rates and rising temperatures and likely due to a currently unknown influence from atmospheric pollutant deposition. Climatic and meteorological impacts on this, and other, Andean glacier have been previously studied; however, cryosphere changes driven by aerosols are still largely unknown. To contribute to the understanding of the origin of aerosols and their dispersion, this study aims to identify natural and anthropogenic sources of air pollution deposited on the Tapado Glacier (4500–5536 m a.s.l.) and their transport by using a receptor model (positive matrix factorization) together with the concentration of major ions as proxies of air pollution deposited on this glacier. This model’s outcomes were complemented with daily wind backward trajectories computed for a whole year using the HYSPLYT meteorological model. Four sources were identified as the main contributors to major soluble ions in the Tapado surface snow. These sources are natural Aeolian dust (38\%) from the Atacama Desert (including mining sites), natural weathered sulphates (27\%), anthropogenic nitrates (25\%), and coastal aerosols (10\%). Coastal nitrate emissions and coastal aerosols are both sources with an important anthropogenic component, coming from La Serena and Coquimbo’s coastal cities. The crustal components and sulphate profiles are similar to detritus dispersed from the glacier after wind erosion. Although the glacier is located over 4000 m above sea level, anthropogenic pollutants reached this location. However, their contributions were smaller compared to natural contaminants. Our findings can likely be extended to the nearest glaciers in Northern Chile, which have similar potential contaminant sources from cities, ports, and thriving mining activity. However, these findings may not be suitable for southern Chilean glaciers, which are closer to bigger cities and to smoke from residential heating prevalent in winter months and wildfires during the summer.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Secondary organic aerosols~(SOAs) formed from biogenic volatile organic compounds~(BVOCs) constitute a significant fraction of atmospheric particulate matter and have been recognized to significantly affect the climate and air quality. Atmospheric SOA particulate mass yields and chemical composition result from a complex mixture of oxidation products originating from a diversity of BVOCs. Many laboratory and field experiments have studied SOA particle formation and growth in the recent years. However, a large uncertainty still remains regarding the contribution of BVOCs to SOA. In particular, organic compounds formed from sesquiterpenes have not been thoroughly investigated, and their contribution to SOA remains poorly characterized. In this study, a Filter Inlet for Gases and Aerosols~(FIGAERO) combined with a high-resolution time-of-flight chemical ionization mass spectrometer~(CIMS), with iodide ionization, was used for the simultaneous measurement of gas-phase and particle-phase oxygenated compounds. The aim of the study was to evaluate the relative contribution of sesquiterpene oxidation products to SOA in a springtime hemiboreal forest environment. Our results revealed that monoterpene and sesquiterpene oxidation products were the main contributors to SOA particles. The chemical composition of SOA particles was compared for times when either monoterpene or sesquiterpene oxidation products were dominant and possible key oxidation products for SOA particle formation were identified for both situations. Surprisingly, sesquiterpene oxidation products were the predominant fraction in the particle phase in some periods, while their gas-phase concentrations remained much lower than those of monoterpene products. This can be explained by favorable and effective partitioning of sesquiterpene products into the particle phase. The SOA particle volatility determined from measured thermograms increased when the concentration of sesquiterpene oxidation products in SOA particles was higher than that of monoterpenes. Overall, this study demonstrates that sesquiterpenes may have an important role in atmospheric SOA formation and oxidation chemistry, in particular during the spring recovery period.},

Objective: To identify fetal growth trajectories in-utero and to assess their association with maternal and child characteristics up to 5 years postnatal. Methods: Data from 781 mother–child pairs from the ROLO longitudinal birth cohort study were analyzed. The ROLO study was a randomized control trial of a low glycemic index diet in pregnancy to prevent recurrence of macrosomia. Fetal ultrasound measurements were recorded at 20 and 34 weeks gestation, and birth weight was recorded. Abdominal circumference (AC), weight (fetal weight, or birth weight), a standardized proxy for length (femur length or birth length, individually standardized), and AC:length ratio were examined for trajectory classes using latent class trajectory mixture models. Two-, three-, four-, and five-class models were evaluated for fit, using a linear (first order) trajectory over three time-points. ANOVA and chi-square tests were applied to test associations between trajectory membership and maternal and child characteristics up to age 5. Results: For AC, two fetal growth trajectories were identified, with 29\% of participants on a “slow” trajectory and 71\% on a “fast” trajectory. Those on a fast trajectory had higher rates of maternal impaired glucose tolerance (28.7 versus 16.5\%, p {$<$} .001) and higher rates of mean child 5-year body mass index (BMI) centiles (64th versus 58th centile, p {$<$} .05) compared to those on the slow trajectory. For estimated fetal weight, four trajectories were identified, with 4\% on a “very-slow” trajectory, 63\% in a “moderate-slow” trajectory, 30\% in a “moderate-fast” trajectory and 3\% on a “very-fast” trajectory. Mothers with a fetus on the fastest trajectory had higher antenatal serum glucose levels (p {$<$} .05), and were more likely to deliver by cesarean section (59.1 versus 20\%, p {$<$} .001). At 5 years of age, children on the fastest growth trajectory had the highest mean BMI centile (86th versus 60th centile, p {$<$} .05). Conclusions: This study shows that specific fetal growth trajectories may be associated with maternal serum glucose concentrations during pregnancy, mode of delivery and child BMI at 5 years of age. Diet and lifestyle measures that target maternal glucose levels during pregnancy may have lifelong benefits for children’s BMI. Identifying those on an accelerated growth trajectory during fetal life provides a unique opportunity for antenatal and infant interventions that may have long-lasting health benefits.},

  abstract = {Exposure to atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with cardiorespiratory morbidity and mortality, but the mechanisms are not well understood. We assess the hypothesis that PM2.5 induces oxidative stress in the body via catalytic generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). A dithiothreitol (DTT) assay was used to measure the ROS-generation potential of water-soluble PM2.5. Source apportionment on ambient (Atlanta, GA) PM2.5 was performed using the chemical mass balance method with ensemble-averaged source impact profiles. Linear regression analysis was used to relate PM2.5 emission sources to ROS-generation potential and to estimate historical levels of DTT activity for use in an epidemiologic analysis for the period of 1998-2009. Light-duty gasoline vehicles (LDGV) exhibited the highest intrinsic DTT activity, followed by biomass burning (BURN) and heavy-duty diesel vehicles (HDDV) (0.11 ± 0.02, 0.069 ± 0.02, and 0.052 ± 0.01 nmol min-1 μg-1source, respectively). BURN contributed the largest fraction to total DTT activity over the study period, followed by LDGV and HDDV (45, 20, and 14\%, respectively). DTT activity was more strongly associated with emergency department visits for asthma/wheezing and congestive heart failure than PM2.5. This work provides further epidemiologic evidence of a biologically plausible mechanism, that of oxidative stress, for associations of adverse health outcomes with PM2.5 mass and supports continued assessment of the utility of the DTT activity assay as a measure of ROS-generating potential of particles.},

  abstract = {Oxidative potential (OP) of particulate matter measures the ability of particles to catalytically generate reactive oxygen species while simultaneously depleting antioxidants, leading to oxidative stress and, in turn, inflammation in the respiratory tract and cardiovascular system. OP measurements have been linked with adverse cardiorespiratory endpoints, such as asthma/wheezing, lung cancer, and ischemic heart disease. However, measurements of OP are limited, restricting the area over which epidemiologic analyses can be performed. In this work, a modeling approach is developed and evaluated that uses limited measurements of water-soluble OP and PM2.5 source impact analysis to estimate OP over a large spatial domain (eastern United States). The dithiothreitol (DTT) assay was used to measure daily OP of water-soluble PM2.5 from June 2012 to July 2013 across four sites in the southeastern United States. Daily PM2.5 source impacts were estimated using CMAQ-DDM during the same time period and related to OPDTT measurements via multivariate linear regression. This regression was then applied to spatial fields of daily CMAQ-DDM source impacts across the eastern United States to provide daily spatially-varying OPDTT estimates. Backward selection during regression development showed vehicle and biomass burning emissions to be significantly predictive of OPDTT, as observed in previous studies. The fire source impact was the largest contributor to OPDTT (29\%) across the study domain during the study time period, and both spatial and seasonal variations were largely driven by fires. Vehicular impacts, especially diesel impacts, were more significant in urban areas. This CMAQ-DDM modeling approach provides a powerful tool for integrating OP measurements from multiple locations and times into a model that can provide spatio-temporal exposure fields of OPDTT across a wide spatial domain for use in health analyses, and the results offer insight into the large-scale spatial distribution of OPDTT driven by emission source impacts.},

  abstract = {Oxidative stress is a potential mechanism of action for particulate matter (PM) toxicity and can occur when the body's antioxidant capacity cannot counteract or detoxify harmful effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to an excess presence of ROS. ROS are introduced to the body via inhalation of PM with these species present on and/or within the particles (particle-bound ROS) and/or through catalytic generation of ROS in vivo after inhaling redox-active PM species (oxidative potential, OP). The recent development of acellular OP measurement techniques has led to a surge in research across the globe. In this review, particle-bound ROS techniques are discussed briefly while OP measurements are the focus due to an increasing number of epidemiologic studies using OP measurements showing associations with adverse health effects in some studies. The most common OP measurement techniques, including the dithiothreitol assay, glutathione assay, and ascorbic acid assay, are discussed along with evidence for utility of OP measurements in epidemiologic studies and PM characteristics that drive different responses between assay types (such as species composition, emission source, and photochemistry). Overall, most OP assays respond to metals like copper than can be found in emission sources like vehicles. Some OP assays respond to organics, especially photochemically aged organics, from sources like biomass burning. Select OP measurements have significant associations with certain cardiorespiratory end points, such as asthma, congestive heart disease, and lung cancer. In fact, multiple studies have found that exposure to OP measured using the dithiothreitol and glutathione assays drives higher risk ratios for certain cardiorespiratory outcomes than PM mass, suggesting OP measurements may be integrating the health-relevant fraction of PM and will be useful tools for future health analyses. The compositional impacts, including species and emission sources, on OP could have serious implications for health-relevant PM exposure. Though more work is needed, OP assays show promise for health studies as they integrate the impacts of PM species and properties on catalytic redox reactions into one measurement, and current work highlights the importance of metals, organic carbon, vehicles, and biomass burning emissions to PM exposures that could impact health.},

  abstract = {While their presence at the outlet of IC engines has been attested, the formation of short-chain monocarboxylic acids, formic (HCOOH), acetic (CH3COOH), propionic (C2H5COOH) or acrylic (C2H3COOH)) acids has very rarely been reported in laboratory combustion systems. In order to better understand their potential formation, detailed kinetic mechanisms have been proposed and tested. A first model has been used to simulate lean (equivalence ratios from 0.9 to 0.48) laminar premixed flames of propane stabilized at atmospheric pressure. It was found that amounts up to 40ppm of formic acid, 25ppm of acetic acid and 1ppm of C3 acids, mainly acrylic acid, can be formed. A quite acceptable agreement has been obtained with the scarce results from the literature concerning oxygenated compounds, including aldehydes and acids. A reaction pathways analysis demonstrated that each acid is mainly derived from the aldehyde of similar structure, with a dominant role of OH. radicals. Based on this first one, a second model has allowed us to simulate a flame of propane doped by toluene and to show, as it was experimentally observed, an enhancement of the formation of C3 acid, which could be due to the addition of OH. radicals to cyclopentadienone. A third model has been proposed to qualitatively explain the formation of acids during the pre-ignition phase (temperatures below 1100K) in an HCCI (Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition) engine alimented by a n-heptane/iso-octane mixture (equivalence ratio of 0.3). Noticeable amounts of monocarboxylic acids could derive from the secondary reactions of ketones or cyclic ethers, which are important products of the oxidation of alkanes at low temperature. These amounts remain too low compared to what is actually observed at the outlet of engines. Copyright © Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

  abstract = {Background: Air pollution has been associated with cardiovascular mortality, but it remains unclear as to whether specific pollutants are related to specific cardiovascular causes of death. Within the multicenter European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE), we investigated the associations of long-term exposure to several air pollutants with all cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, as well as with specific cardiovascular causes of death. Methods: Data from 22 European cohort studies were used. Using a standardized protocol, study area-specific air pollution exposure at the residential address was characterized as annual average concentrations of the following: nitrogen oxides (NO2and NOx); particles with diameters of less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5), less than 10 μm (PM10), and 10 μm to 2.5 μm (PMcoarse); PM2.5absorbance estimated by land-use regression models; and traffic indicators. We applied cohort-specific Cox proportional hazards models using a standardized protocol. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to obtain pooled effect estimates. Results: The total study population consisted of 367,383 participants, with 9994 deaths from CVD (including 4,992 from ischemic heart disease, 2264 from myocardial infarction, and 2484 from cerebrovascular disease). All hazard ratios were approximately 1.0, except for particle mass and cerebrovascular disease mortality; for PM2.5, the hazard ratio was 1.21 (95\% confidence interval = 0.87-1.69) per 5 μg/m and for PM10, 1.22 (0.91-1.63) per 10 μg/m. Conclusion: In a joint analysis of data from 22 European cohorts, most hazard ratios for the association of air pollutants with mortality from overall CVD and with specific CVDs were approximately 1.0, with the exception of particulate mass and cerebrovascular disease mortality for which there was suggestive evidence for an association.

  abstract = {The Chemical Mass Balance (CMB) model is one of several receptor models that have been applied to air quality management. This model quantifies contributions using chemical signatures characterizing source-types rather than contributions from individual emitters. The CMB model uses the chemical composition of ambient pollution samples to estimate the contributions of different source types to the measured pollutant concentrations. The disadvantage of the model is that it cannot separate the sources having similar chemical compositions or for those sources for which source composition profiles are unavailable. Since CMB analysis is done on a sample-bysample basis, it is possible to estimate the daily contributions of individual sources, and can thereby provide useful information based on a limited number of samples to address air quality management issues. Samples of fine and coarse fractions of airborne particulate matter (PM) were collected using a ‘Gent’ stacked filter unit in two fractions of 0-2.2 μm and 2.2-10 μm sizes in a semi-residential (Atomic Energy Centre Dhaka, AECD) area from June 2001 to June 2002 of Dhaka. These samples were analyzed for elemental concentrations with PIXE. The chemical composition data set was analyzed by CMB using local source profiles obtained using a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and regression analysis of data from this site and the source contributions are quantitatively estimated for each of the samples. The results of the CMB analysis were compared with the results obtained using positive matrix factorization (PMF) that had been done previously. It is observed that CMB provides comparable results except for limited discrepancies, especially for the PM2.2 fractions where sources have similar elemental signatures.},

In addition, meteorological conditions during the winter cause increases in the fine particulate matter concentrations by factors of 4 to 5 fold compared to the rainy season. To understand the contribution of possible pollution sources, compositional data for both the coarse and fine fractions samples collected between May 2001 and March 2005 have been analyzed using Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF). The results were compared with the previous source apportionment results. Conditional Probability Function (CPF) plots were developed for each source using local wind data to explore the directionality of local sources. Back trajectory ensemble methods were used to identify potential source regions and pathways of transboundary transport of PM2.2 apportioned sources. The Potential Source Contribution Function (PSCF) domain extended around the receptor site in Dhaka (23.77°N, 90.38°E) over the range from 1.5° to 42.5°N and 56.5° to 110.5°E. The PSCF results are compared to the conditional probability function (CPF) analyses that use 3 hour average local wind directional data to determine the likely directions for the sources. Both PSCF and CPF help to identify the potential source locations, but on different distance scales. These analyses demonstrate that coarse particles are dominated by local sources. However, local and regional source contributed to the elevated fine PM levels in Dhaka. Thus, regional control efforts will be required in addition to local initiatives to improve the air quality in mega cities in this region like Dhaka.},

Consistent records were identified for source contribution estimates of PM mass concentrations for 272 records and of organic carbon (OC) in PM for 60 records. Over the period 2000-2012, a shift was observed in the use of RMs from principal component analysis, enrichment factors, and classical factor analysis to Positive Matrix Factorization while Chemical Mass Balance is still topical.Following a meta-analysis of the published results, six major source categories for PM were defined that comprise almost all individual sources apportioned in Europe: atmospheric formation of secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA), traffic, re-suspension of crustal/mineral dust, biomass burning, (industrial) point sources, and sea/road salt. For the OC fraction, the three main source categories were: atmospheric formation of secondary organic aerosol, biomass burning, and fossil fuel combustion. The geographical and seasonal variations of these sources are mapped and discussed.A special analysis of PM concentrations that exceed the current European air quality limits indicated SIA and traffic as the most important source categories to target for abatement throughout the year together with biomass burning during the cold season. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The performance and the uncertainty of receptor models (RMs) were assessed in intercomparison exercises employing real-world and synthetic input datasets. To that end, the results obtained by different practitioners using ten different RMs were compared with a reference. In order to explain the differences in the performances and uncertainties of the different approaches, the apportioned mass, the number of sources, the chemical profiles, the contribution-to-species and the time trends of the sources were all evaluated using the methodology described in Belis et al. (2015). In this study, 87\% of the 344 source contribution estimates (SCEs) reported by participants in 47 different source apportionment model results met the 50\% standard uncertainty quality objective established for the performance test. In addition, 68\% of the SCE uncertainties reported in the results were coherent with the analytical uncertainties in the input data. The most used models, EPA-PMF v.3, PMF2 and EPA-CMB 8.2, presented quite satisfactory performances in the estimation of SCEs while unconstrained models, that do not account for the uncertainty in the input data (e.g. APCS and FA-MLRA), showed below average performance. Sources with well-defined chemical profiles and seasonal time trends, that make appreciable contributions ({$>$}10\%), were those better quantified by the models while those with contributions to the PM mass close to 1\% represented a challenge. The results of the assessment indicate that RMs are capable of estimating the contribution of the major pollution source categories over a given time window with a level of accuracy that is in line with the needs of air quality management.},

  abstract = {A new methodology to assess source apportionment model performance in intercomparison exercises, encompassing the preparation of real-world and synthetic datasets and the evaluation of the source apportionment results reported by participants, is described. The evaluation consists of three types of tests: complementary tests, preliminary tests, and performance tests. The complementary tests provide summary information about the source apportionment results as a whole. The preliminary tests check whether source/factors belong to a given source category. Three types of indicators: Pearson correlation (Pearson), standardized identity distance (SID), and weighted difference (WD) are used to test factor/ source chemical profiles, while factor/source time series and contribution-to-species values are tested only using the Pearson. The performance tests, based on international standards for proficiency testing, are targeted at evaluating whether the reported biases in the quantification of the factor/source contribution estimates (SCEs) and uncertainties are consistent with previously established quality standards in a fitness-for-purpose approach. Moreover, the consistency of the SCE time series is evaluated using a variant of the RMSE normalised by the reference standard uncertainty.},

  abstract = {The use of high time resolution datasets of aerosol organic and inorganic species as input for receptor models poses a number of challenges. The estimation of uncertainties differ between different analytical methods and the number of chemical species may considerably vary among the different techniques. In this study, an approach to harmonise the uncertainties of different online datasets for their combined use in source apportionment with positive matrix factorization (PMF) is presented. The concentration of inorganic ions, organic fragments and trace elements were measured in a Po Valley background site using offline and online methods. Six-hour PM 2.5 samples were collected on filters and chemical analyses were carried out offline. Parallel hourly online measurements were made using the Xact 625 (CES LLC) XRF analyser and the Q-ACSM (Aerodyne Research Inc.) spectrometer. Online and offline methods produced comparable results for the major chemical component and some trace elements, while others (Ba, Ni, As and Se) showed limited comparability between the two methods. To ensure the consistency of the final PMF results, a multistep approach was adopted. In the first step PMF was run with only the offline dataset, in the second step only the online organic data were used and in a third step the PMF run was executed using only the online inorganic species. In the first three steps running PMF with homogeneous data made it possible to identify the main sources and produce chemical profiles to be used as internal reference for the final fourth step in which all the online species (major inorganic ions, m/z of organic fragments and trace elements) were combined. The sources of the final solution were developed using internally consistent chemical profiles and those from the literature and were validated by analysing the source diurnal variations and by comparison with external tracers. The sources identified were: biomass burning, aged biomass burning, secondary ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulphate, traffic, steel industry and waste thermal treatment. The source profiles with a large set of organic and inorganic species (87) and associated source diurnal variations resulting from this study are expected to serve as reference for future studies.},

  abstract = {In this study, the performance of two types of source apportionment models was evaluated by assessing the results provided by 40 different groups in the framework of an intercomparison organised by FAIRMODE WG3 (Forum for air quality modelling in Europe, Working Group 3). The evaluation was based on two performance indicators: z-scores and the root mean square error weighted by the reference uncertainty (RMSEu), with pre-established acceptability criteria. By involving models based on completely different and independent input data, such as receptor models (RMs) and chemical transport models (CTMs), the intercomparison provided a unique opportunity for their cross-validation. In addition, comparing the CTM chemical profiles with those measured directly at the source contributed to corroborate the consistency of the tested model results. The most commonly used RM was the US EPA- PMF version 5. RMs showed very good performance for the overall dataset (91\% of z-scores accepted) while more difficulties were observed with the source contribution time series (72\% of RMSEu accepted). Industrial activities proved to be the most difficult sources to be quantified by RMs, with high variability in the estimated contributions. In the CTMs, the sum of computed source contributions was lower than the measured gravimetric PM10 mass concentrations. The performance tests pointed out the differences between the two CTM approaches used for source apportionment in this study: brute force (or emission reduction impact) and tagged species methods. The sources meeting the z-score and RMSEu acceptability criteria tests were 50\% and 86\%, respectively. The CTM source contributions to PM10 were in the majority of cases lower than the RM averages for the corresponding source. The CTMs and RMs source contributions for the overall dataset were more comparable (83\% of the z-scores accepted) than their time series (successful RMSEu in the range 25\% - 34\%). The comparability between CTMs and RMs varied depending on the source: traffic/exhaust and industry were the source categories with the best results in the RMSEu tests while the most critical ones were soil dust and road dust. The differences between RMs and CTMs source reconstructions confirmed the importance of cross validating the results of these two families of models.},

In fact, advanced statistical methods are necessary to address the challenges inherent in the detection of a relatively small pollution risk in the presence of potential confounders. This paper reviews the history, methods, and findings of the time-series studies estimating health risks associated with short-term exposure to particulate matter (PM), though much of the discussion is applicable to epidemiological studies of air pollution in general. We review the critical role of epidemiological studies in setting regulatory standards and the history of PM epidemiology and time-series analysis. We also summarize recent time-series results and conclude with a discussion of current and future directions of time-series analysis of particulates, including research on mortality displacement and the resolution of results from cohort and time-series studies.},

  abstract = {Insufficient data on the chemical composition of PM2.5 and its emission sources in the southwestern (SW) Mediterranean area has been identified. Ambient PM2.5 samples were collected in an urban area of Tetouan city, northern Morocco. Chemical mass closure calculations and positive matrix factorization were performed for the comprehensive dataset of PM2.5 chemical analyses. Mass closure improved when multipliers (1.2 and 0.23, respectively) were used for the conversion of organic carbon (OC) and calcium ion (Ca2+) into particulate organic matter (POM) and mineral dust masses, respectively. The mass closure model performed well in this SW Mediterranean region, with a significant correlation (r2 = 0.97) obtained between gravimetrically measured and chemically determined PM2.5 mass. The one-year average concentration of PM2.5 was 17.96 µg/m3, and the major chemical components were POM (34\%), secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) (28\%), and black carbon (18\%), while unidentified mass was 4\%. The mass concentration and most of the chemical components of PM2.5 showed clear seasonal variations, with a summer-high and winter-low pattern for SIA, dust, and BC. In the winter months, POM was the dominant component. Source apportionment analysis revealed that PM2.5 emission sources, regarding their typical tracers, were ammonium sulfate (SO42−, NH4+, K+, NO3−), road traffic and biomass burning emissions (OC, BC), fresh sea salt (Cl−, K+, NO3−), aged sea salt (Mg2+, Na+, Ca2+), and oxalate-rich (oxalate, NO3−) factors. Further, it is hoped that these findings help to improve the scientific understanding of SW Mediterranean aerosols.},

  abstract = {Deep learning algorithms have improved predictive model performance in a variety of disciplines because of their ability to approximate complex functions. However, the amount of data and depth of the neural network needed to improve model performance is not well understood and may depend on many factors associated with the specific field of research. In ecology, ecologists rely on accurate species distribution models to inform conservation and management efforts. Here, we present the first study to systematically examine the effects of sample size and network depth on the performance of species distribution models built with artificial neural networks. We found that one or several deeper network architectures ({$>$}1 hidden layer) consistently led to slightly higher model performance than a shallow neural network on validation data when trained with a large sample size (10,000 sites). However, comparing deep network model performance with random forest model performance showed that random forest generally performed as well or slightly better. There was no clear or consistent benefit of using deep neural networks with smaller sample sizes (100 and 1000 sites). Our results suggest that, given sufficiently big data, increasing the number of hidden layers in a neural network can potentially improve species distribution model performance. As datasets become larger and high performance computing resources become more available, a deep learning approach to species distribution modeling is likely to be used more frequently.},

They were analyzed by means of neutron activation analysis, and the elemental concentrations were determined. A positive matrix factorization (PMF) model was applied to the results obtained for source apportionment. According to the PMF model, five sources were identified: soil dust, aged sea salt, road dust, lignite power plants, and a Mn-rich source. The soil dust source contributed the most to almost all samples (46\% of elemental concentrations, on average). Two areas with significant impact from anthropogenic activities were identified. In West Macedonia, the emissions from a lignite power plant complex located in the area have caused high concentrations of Ni, V, Cr, and Co. The second most impacted area was Skouries, where mining activities and vehicular traffic (probably related to the mining operations) led to high concentrations of Mn, Ni, V, Co, Sb, and Cr.},

A Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) based source apportionment study was carried out using chemical composition data of PM10 and PM1 filter samples from 79 selected days in a pooled dataset yielding eight source related factors. High to moderate urban versus regional correlations are obtained for factors denoted as aged marine aerosol, aged mineral dust, secondary sulfate and fossil fuel combustion. The factors identified as secondary nitrate, biomass combustion, re-suspended road dust and industry do not correlate significantly. Since the PMF factors do not represent the natural sources in the meaning of the EU air quality directive, tracer methods based on sodium, chloride and calcium are proposed to infer the PM10 concentrations of natural sea salt, mineral dust background, and the impact of long-range dust intrusions on PM10 concentrations, respectively. These tracer methods are viewed suitable for application in routine source apportionment within the air quality monitoring network. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

In India, the emission sources defining PM-OP, and their local/regional nature, are yet to be established. Here, to address this gap we determine the geographical origin, sources of PM, and its OP at five Indo-Gangetic Plain sites inside and outside Delhi. Our findings reveal that although uniformly high PM concentrations are recorded across the entire region, local emission sources and formation processes dominate PM pollution. Specifically, ammonium chloride, and organic aerosols (OA) from traffic exhaust, residential heating, and oxidation of unsaturated vapors from fossil fuels are the dominant PM sources inside Delhi. Ammonium sulfate and nitrate, and secondary OA from biomass burning vapors, are produced outside Delhi. Nevertheless, PM-OP is overwhelmingly driven by OA from incomplete combustion of biomass and fossil fuels, including traffic. These findings suggest that addressing local inefficient combustion processes can effectively mitigate PM health exposure in northern India.},

Despite the high abundances of oxalic acid and related compounds in the marine aerosols, there is no consensus on what controls their distributions over the open ocean. Marine biological productivity could play a role in the production of DCA, but there is no substantial evidence to support this hypothesis. Here we present latitudinal distributions of DCA, oxoacids and α-dicarbonyls in the marine aerosols from the remote Pacific. Their concentrations were found several times higher in more biologically influenced aerosols (MBA) than less biologically influenced aerosols. We propose isoprene and unsaturated fatty acids as sources of DCA as inferred from significantly higher abundances of isoprene-SOA tracers and azelaic acid in MBA. These results have implications toward the reassessment of climate forcing feedbacks of marine-derived SOA. © 2014. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.},

  abstract = {Diesel exhaust has been classified a probable human carcinogen, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has recommended that employers reduce workers' exposures. Because diesel exhaust is a chemically complex mixture containing thousands of compounds, some measure of exposure must be selected. Previously used methods involving gravimetry or anaiysis of the soluble organic fraction of diesel soot lack adequate sensitivity and selectivity for low-level determination of particulate diesel exhaust; a new analytical approach was therefore needed. In this paper, results of investigation of a thermaloptical technique for analysis of the carbonaceous fraction of particulate diesel exhaust are reported. With this technique, speciation of organic and elemental carbon is accomplished through temperature and atmosphere control, and by an optical feature that corrects for pyrolytically generated carbon, or "char," which is formed during the analysis of some materials. The thermal-optical method was selected because the instrument has desirable design features not present in other carbon analyzers. Although various carbon types are determined, elemental carbon is the superior marker of diesel particulate matter because elemental carbon constitutes a large fraction of the particulate mass, it can be quantified at low levels, and its only significant source in most workplaces is the diesel engine. Exposurerelated issues and results of investigation of various sampling methods for particulate diesel exhaust also are discussed. AEROSOLSCIENCEAND TECHNOLOGY 25:221-241 (1996).},

  abstract = {Airborne particles and pollutant gases are of increasing concern due to their adverse health effects, necessitating a thorough understanding of their composition, sources, spatial and temporal trends for effective air quality management. This study is part of a source apportionment study in Auckland, a dynamic urban environment with complex air quality challenges in an isolated Southern Ocean setting. Over the 2006–2016 period, concentrations of PM2.5, CO, NO2, and SO2 consistently decreased at all 4 monitoring sites indicating the impacts of control measures. The sources impacting the four sites were identified using the positive matrix factorisation (PMF) receptor model. Common sources affecting these sites included motor vehicles (both petrol and diesel), biomass burning, sea salt, sulphate/marine diesel, and soil/road dust. While motor vehicle emissions and biomass burning emerged as the primary contributors to PM2.5, BC, NO2, CO, and SO2, motor vehicle contributions declined due to advancements in fuel formulation and engine technology despite increased vehicle numbers. Biomass burning contributed substantially to winter PM2.5 concentrations driven by domestic heating practices. However, the introduction of alternative heating technologies mitigated the upward trends in biomass burning emissions despite an increasing residential population. Soil/road dust contributions varied by site, influenced by meteorological conditions and local activities, with implications for site-specific air quality management. Sulphate/ marine diesel concentrations exhibited seasonal variability, reflecting the impact of both shipping emissions and natural sources. Urban sulphate concentrations decreased due to regulations requiring the introduction of lowsulphur automotive gasoline and diesel fuels. Sea salt, a naturally occurring source, posed challenges for management efforts with concentrations trending downwards over time, possibly linked to climate patterns. This study’s source apportionment analysis provides critical insights into Auckland’s air quality. The findings inform policy development, air quality management, and health impact assessments, benefiting both the Auckland region and New Zealand as a whole. Ongoing monitoring and emissions reduction strategies, particularly targeting motor vehicles and biomass burning, are pivotal for enhancing air quality and public health in the region.},

We undertook a cross-sectional study of 360 school children aged 5–12 years who lived on the outskirts of a heavy industrial area in Western Australia to investigate the effect of a range of environmental factors on respiratory health using the forced oscillation technique (FOT), a non-invasive method that allows for the assessment of the resistive and reactive properties of the respiratory system. Based on home address, proximity calculations were used to estimate children’s exposure to air pollution from traffic and industry and to characterise surrounding green space. Indoor factors were determined using a housing questionnaire. Of the outdoor measures, the length of major roads within a 50 m buffer was associated with increased airway resistance (Rrs8). There were no associations between distance to industry and FOT measures. For the indoor environment the presence of wood heating and gas heating in the first year of life was associated with better lung function. The significance of both indoor and outdoor sources of air pollution and effect modifiers such as green space and heating require further investigation.},

  abstract = {Background: Air pollution can cause respiratory symptoms or exacerbate pre-existing respiratory diseases, especially in children. This study looked at the short-term association of air pollution concentrations with Emergency Room (ER) admissions for respiratory reasons in pediatric age (0–18 years). Methods: Daily number of ER admissions in a children’s Hospital, concentrations of urban-background PM2.5, NO2, O3 and total aeroallergens (Corylaceae, Cupressaceae, Gramineae, Urticaceae, Ambrosia, Betula) were collected in Turin, northwestern Italy, for the period 1/08/2008 to 31/12/2010 (883 days). The associations between exposures and ER admissions were estimated, at time lags between 0 and 5 days, using generalized linear Poisson regression models, adjusted for non-meteorological potential confounders. Results: In the study period, 21,793 ER admissions were observed, mainly (81 \%) for upper respiratory tract infections. Median air pollution concentrations were 22.0, 42.5, 34.1 μg/m3 for urban-background PM2.5, NO2, and O3, respectively, and 2.9 grains/m3 for aeroallergens. We found that ER admissions increased by 1.3 \% (95 \% CI: 0.32.2 \%) five days after a 10 μg/m3 increase in NO2, and by 0.7 \% (95 \% CI: 0.1-1.2 \%) one day after a 10 grains/m3 increase in aeroallergens, while they were not associated with PM2.5 concentrations. ER admissions were negatively associated with O3 and aeroallergen concentrations at some time lags, but these association shifted to the null when meteorological confounders were adjusted for in the models. Conclusions: Overall, these findings confirm adverse short-term health effects of air pollution on the risk of ER admission in children and encourage a careful management of the urban environment to health protection.},

  abstract = {Changes in energy and environmental policies along with changes in the energy markets of New York State over the past two decades, have spurred interest in evaluating their impacts on emissions from various energy generation sectors. This study focused on quantifying these effects on VOC (volatile organic compounds) emissions and their subsequent impacts on air quality within the New York City (NYC) metropolitan area. NYC is an EPA nonattainment region for ozone (O3) and likely is a VOC limited region. NYC has a complex coastal topography and meteorology with low-level jets and sea/bay/land breeze circulation associated with heat waves, leading to summertime O3 exceedances and formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). To date, no comprehensive source apportionment studies have been done to understand the contributions of local and long-range sources of VOCs in this area. This study applied an improved Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) methodology designed to incorporate atmospheric dispersion and photochemical reaction losses of VOCs to provide improved apportionment results. Hourly measurements of VOCs were obtained from a Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Station located at an urban site in the Bronx from 2000 to 2021. The study further explores the role of VOC sources in O3 and SOA formation and leverages advanced machine learning tools, XGBoost and SHAP algorithms, to identify synergistic interactions between sources and provided VOC source impacts on ambient O3 concentrations. Isoprene demonstrated a substantial influence in the source contribution of the biogenic factor, emphasizing its role in O3 formation. Notable contributions from anthropogenic emissions, such as fuel evaporation and various industrial processes, along with significant traffic-related sources that likely contribute to SOA formation, underscore the combined impact of natural and human-made sources on O3 pollution. Findings of this study can assist regulatory agencies in developing appropriate policy and management initiatives to control O3 pollution in NYC.},

  abstract = {The oxidative potential (OP) and chemical characteristics of fine particles collected from urban, roadside, rural, and industrial sites in Korea during spring, summer, fall, and winter seasons and an urban site in the Philippines during dry and wet seasons were examined. Significant differences in the OP of fine particles among sites and seasons were found. The industrial site yielded the highest OP activity (both mass and volume-normalized OP) among the sites, suggesting the strongest reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating capability of industry source-dominant PM2.5. Seasonal data show that OP activities increased during the spring and summer possibly due to increased heavy metals caused by dust events and secondary organic aerosols formed by strong photochemical activity, respectively. The strength of the OP association with the chemical components highlights the influence of organic carbon and transition metals on the OP of ambient fine particles. The two OP assays (dithiothreitol (DTT) and electron spin resonance (ESR)) having different ROS-generating mechanisms were found to have different sensitivities to the chemical components facilitating a complementary analysis of the OP of ambient fine particles. Multiple linear regression model equations (OP as a function of chemical components) which were dependent on the sites were derived. A comparison of the daily OP and hazard index (HI) (the ratio of the measured mass concentration to the reference mass concentration of fine particles) suggests that the HI may not be sufficient to accurately estimate the health effects of fine particles, and a direct or indirect measurement of toxicity such as OP should be required in addition to the concentration level. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The oxidative potential (OP) of particulate matter (PM) measures PM capability to potentially cause anti-oxidant imbalance. Due to the wide range and complex mixture of species in particulates, little is known about the pollution sources most strongly contributing to OP. A 1-year sampling of PM10 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter below 10) was performed over different sites in a medium-sized city (Grenoble, France). An enhanced fine-scale apportionment of PM10 sources, based on the chemical composition, was performed using the positive matrix factorization (PMF) method and reported in a companion paper (Borlaza et al., 2020). OP was assessed as the ability of PM10 to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) using three different acellular assays: dithiothreitol (DTT), ascorbic acid (AA), and 2,7-dichlorofluorescein (DCFH) assays. Using multiple linear regression (MLR), the OP contributions of the sources identified by PMF were estimated. Conversely, since atmospheric processes are usually non-linear in nature, artificial neural network (ANN) techniques, which employ non-linear models, could further improve estimates. Hence, the multilayer perceptron analysis (MLP), an ANN-based model, was additionally used to model OP based on PMF-resolved sources as well. This study presents the spatiotemporal variabilities of OP activity with influences by season-specific sources, site typology and specific local features, and assay sensitivity. Overall, both MLR and MLP effectively captured the evolution of OP. The primary traffic and biomass burning sources were the strongest drivers of OP in the Grenoble basin. There is also a clear redistribution of source-specific impacts when using OP instead of mass concentration, underlining the importance of PM redox activity for the identification of potential sources of PM toxicity. Finally, the MLP generally offered improvements in OP prediction, especially for sites where synergistic and/or antagonistic effects between sources are prominent, supporting the value of using ANN-based models to account for the non-linear dynamics behind the atmospheric processes affecting OP of PM10.},

A fine-scale source apportionment of PM10 was conducted in three different urban sites (background, hyper-center, and peri-urban) within 15 km of the city in Grenoble, France using Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF 5.0) on measured chemical species from collected filters (24 h) from February 2017 to March 2018. To improve the PMF solution, several new organic tracers (3-MBTCA, pinic acid, phthalic acid, MSA, and cellulose) were additionally used in order to identify sources that are commonly unresolved by classic PMF methodologies. An 11-factor solution was obtained in all sites, including commonly identified sources from primary traffic (13 \%), nitrate-rich (17 \%), sulfate-rich (17 \%), industrial (1 \%), biomass burning (22 \%), aged sea salt (4 \%), sea/road salt (3 \%), and mineral dust (7 \%), and the newly found sources from primary biogenic (4 \%), secondary biogenic oxidation (10 \%), and MSA-rich (3 \%). Generally, the chemical species exhibiting similar temporal trends and strong correlations showed uniformly distributed emission sources in the Grenoble basin. The improved PMF model was able to obtain and differentiate chemical profiles of specific sources even at high proximity of receptor locations, confirming its applicability in a fine-scale resolution. In order to test the similarities between the PMF-resolved sources, the Pearson distance and standardized identity distance (PD-SID) of the factors in each site were compared. The PD-SID metric determined whether a given source is homogeneous (i.e., with similar chemical profiles) or heterogeneous over the three sites, thereby allowing better discrimination of localized characteristics of specific sources. Overall, the addition of the new tracers allowed the identification of substantial sources (especially in the SOA fraction) that would not have been identified or possibly mixed with other factors, resulting in an enhanced resolution and sound source profile of urban air quality at a city scale.},

In this study, 9-year sampling of PM10 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter below 10 μm) was performed in a rural background site in France (Observatoire Pérenne de l'Environnement or OPE) from 28 February 2012 to 22 December 2020. The positive matrix factorization (PMF) method was used to apportion sources of PM10 based on quantified chemical constituents and specific chemical tracers analysed on collected filters. Oxidative potential (OP), an emerging health metric that measures PM capability to potentially cause anti-oxidant imbalance in the lung, was also measured using two acellular assays: dithiothreitol (DTT) and ascorbic acid (AA). The sources of OP were also estimated using multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis. In terms of mass contribution, the dominant sources are secondary aerosols (nitrate-and sulfate-rich) associated with long-range transport (LRT). However, in terms of OP contributions, the main drivers are traffic, mineral dust, and biomass burning factors. There is also some OP contribution apportioned to the sulfate-and nitrate-rich sources influenced by processes and ageing during LRT that could have encouraged mixing with other anthropogenic sources. The study indicates much lower OP values than in urban areas. A substantial decrease (58 \% reduction from the year 2012 to 2020) in the mass contributions from the traffic factor was found, even though this is not clearly reflected in its OP contribution. Nevertheless, the findings in this long-term study at the OPE site could indicate effectiveness of implemented emission control policies, as also seen in other long-term studies conducted in Europe, mainly for urban areas.},

  abstract = {In Europe, COVID-19 lockdown restrictions were first implemented in March 2020 to control the spread of the disease from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Many studies have focused on the influence of the applied measures on pollution levels during this period, but very limited information on the oxidative potential (OP), an emerging metric of particulate matter (PM) exposure. Furthermore, most previous studies also commonly used comparative methods with historical datasets, which may not be estimating the real pollution levels without the lockdown restrictions in place. In this study, the OP of PM collected at urban background (Grenoble, France) and traffic (Bern, Switzerland) sites was assessed using dithiothreitol (DTT) and ascorbic acid (AA) assays. These measurements were also compared with PM and black carbon (BC) mass concentrations, including the wood burning and fossil fuel fractions of BC. To obtain a more realistic pollution level, assuming there were no lockdown restrictions in place, a machine learning technique called the Random Forest (RF) regression model was applied to predict a business-as-usual (BAU) level for OP, PM, and BC in both sites. This model provided a good estimate of the BAU levels, allowing a more realistic assessment of the pollution changes during the lockdown period. The results indicate a clear decrease in OP found in the traffic site, while a more modest change in OP was found at the urban background site, likely due to sustained contributions from wood burning sources for residential heating. Overall, this study confirms the major roles of both of these combustion sources in the OP levels in ambient air.}

  abstract = {Receptor and Chemical Transport Models are commonly used tools in source apportionment studies, even if different expertise is required. We describe an experiment using both approaches to apportion the PM2.5 (i.e., particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters below 2.5 mm) sources in the city of Genoa (Italy). A sampling campaign was carried out to collect PM2.5 samples daily for approximately six month during 2011 in three sites. The subsequent compositional analyses included the speciation of elements, major ions and both organic and elemental carbon; these data produced a large database for receptor modelling through Positive Matrix Factorisation (PMF). In the same period, a meteorological and air quality modelling system was implemented based on the mesoscale numerical weather prediction model WRF and the chemical transport model CAMx to obtain meteorological and pollutant concentrations up to a resolution of 1.1 km. The source apportionment was evaluated by CAMx over the same period that was used for the monitoring campaign using the Particulate Source Apportionment Technology tool. Even if the source categorisations were changed (i.e., groups of time-correlated compounds in PMF vs. activity categories in CAMx), the PM2.5 source apportionment by PMF and CAMx produced comparable results. The different information provided by the two approaches (e.g., real-world factor profile by PMF and apportionment of a secondary aerosol by CAMx) was used jointly to elucidate the composition and origin of PM2.5 and to develop a more general methodology. When studying the primary and secondary components of PM, the main anthropogenic sources in the area were road transportation, energy production/industry and maritime emissions, accounting for 40\%e50\%, 20\%e30\% and 10\%e15\%, of PM2.5, respectively.},

  abstract = {Receptor Models are tools widely adopted in source apportionment studies. We describe here an experiment in which we integrated two different approaches, i.e. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) and Chemical Mass Balance (CMB) to apportion a set of PM10 (i.e. Particulate Matter with aerodynamic diameter lower than 10 μm) concentration values. The study was performed in the city of Genoa (Italy): a sampling campaign was carried out collecting daily PM10 samples for about two months in an urban background site. PM10 was collected on Quartz fiber filters by a low-volume sampler. A quite complete speciation of PM samples was obtained via Energy Dispersive-X Ray Fluorescence (ED-XRF, for elements), Ionic Chromatography (IC, for major ions and levoglucosan), thermo-optical Analysis (TOT, for organic and elemental carbon). The chemical analyses provided the input database for source apportionment by both PMF and CMB. Source profiles were directly calculated from the input data by PMF while in the CMB runs they were first calculated by averaging the profiles of similar sources collected in the European database SPECIEUROPE. Differences between the two receptor models emerged in particular with PM10 sources linked to very local processes. For this reason, PMF source profiles were adopted in refined CMB runs thus testing a new hybrid approach. Finally, PMF and the “tuned” CMB showed a better agreement even if some discrepancies could not completely been resolved. In this work, we compared the results coming from the last available PMF and CMB versions applied on a set of PM10 samples. Input profiles used in CMB analysis were obtained by averaging the profiles of the new European SPECIEUROPE database. The main differences between PMF and CMB results were linked to very local processes: we obtained the best solution by integrating the two different approaches with the implementation of some output PMF profiles to CMB runs.},

Our finding that BC particles accumulate on the fetal side of the placenta suggests that ambient particulates could be transported towards the fetus and represents a potential mechanism explaining the detrimental health effects of pollution from early life onwards.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ∗ ∗ ∗, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting.

Filter samples were taken from nine sites of varying characteristics across France and Switzerland, with sampling covering all seasons. Concentrations of cellulose, as well as carbonaceous aerosol and other source-specific chemical tracers (e.g. elemental carbon, EC; levoglucosan; polyols; trace metals; and glucose), were quantified. Annual mean free-cellulose concentrations within PM10 (particulate matter) ranged from 29ĝ€¯±ĝ€¯38ĝ€¯ngĝ€¯m-3 at Basel (urban site) to 284ĝ€¯±ĝ€¯225ĝ€¯ngĝ€¯m-3 at Payerne (rural site). Concentrations were considerably higher during episodes, with spikes exceeding 1150 and 2200ĝ€¯ngĝ€¯m-3 at Payerne and ANDRA-OPE (Agence nationale pour la gestion des déchets radioactifs Observatoire Pérenne de l'Environnement; rural site), respectively. A clear seasonality, with highest cellulose concentrations during summer and autumn, was observed at all rural and some urban sites. However, some urban locations exhibited a weakened seasonality. Contributions of cellulose carbon to total organic carbon are moderate on average (0.7ĝ€¯\%-5.9ĝ€¯\%) but much greater during "episodes", reaching close to 20ĝ€¯\% at Payerne. Cellulose concentrations correlated poorly between sites, even at ranges of about 10ĝ€¯km, indicating the localised nature of the sources of atmospheric plant debris. With regards to these sources, correlations between cellulose and typical biogenic chemical tracers (polyols and glucose) were moderate to strong (Rsĝ€¯Combining double low lineĝ€¯0.28-0.78, pĝ€¯{$<$}ĝ€¯0.0001) across the nine sites. Seasonality was strongest at sites with stronger biogenic correlations, suggesting the main source of cellulose arises from biogenic origins. A second input to ambient plant debris concentrations was suggested via resuspension of plant matter at several urban sites, due to moderate cellulose correlations with mineral dust tracers, Ca2+, and Ti metal (Rsĝ€¯Combining double low lineĝ€¯0.28-0.45, pĝ€¯{$<$}ĝ€¯0.007). No correlation was obtained with the biomass burning tracer (levoglucosan), an indication that this is not a source of atmospheric cellulose. Finally, an investigation into the interannual variability in atmospheric cellulose across the Grenoble metropole was completed. It was shown that concentrations and sources of ambient cellulose can vary considerably between years. All together, these results deeply improve our knowledge on the phenomenology of plant debris within ambient air. Copyright:},

  abstract = {In 2004, the first American Heart Association scientific statement on "Air Pollution and Cardiovascular Disease" concluded that exposure to particulate matter (PM) air pollution contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In the interim, numerous studies have expanded our understanding of this association and further elucidated the physiological and molecular mechanisms involved. The main objective of this updated American Heart Association scientific statement is to provide a comprehensive review of the new evidence linking PM exposure with cardiovascular disease, with a specific focus on highlighting the clinical implications for researchers and healthcare providers. The writing group also sought to provide expert consensus opinions on many aspects of the current state of science and updated suggestions for areas of future research. On the basis of the findings of this review, several new conclusions were reached, including the following: Exposure to PM {$<$}2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) over a few hours to weeks can trigger cardiovascular disease-related mortality and nonfatal events; longer-term exposure (eg, a few years) increases the risk for cardiovascular mortality to an even greater extent than exposures over a few days and reduces life expectancy within more highly exposed segments of the population by several months to a few years; reductions in PM levels are associated with decreases in cardiovascular mortality within a time frame as short as a few years; and many credible pathological mechanisms have been elucidated that lend biological plausibility to these findings. It is the opinion of the writing group that the overall evidence is consistent with a causal relationship between PM2.5 exposure and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This body of evidence has grown and been strengthened substantially since the first American Heart Association scientific statement was published. Finally, PM2.5 exposure is deemed a modifiable factor that contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. © 2010 American Heart Association, Inc.},

These methods capture the uncertainty of PMF analyses due to random errors and rotational ambiguity. To demonstrate the utility of the EE methods, results are presented for three data sets: (1) speciated PM2.5 data from a chemical speciation network (CSN) site in Sacramento, California (2003-2009); (2) trace metal, ammonia, and other species in water quality samples taken at an inline storage system (ISS) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin (2006); and (3) an organic aerosol data set from high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-AMS) measurements in Las Vegas, Nevada (January 2008). We present an interpretation of EE diagnostics for these data sets, results from sensitivity tests of EE diagnostics using additional and fewer factors, and recommendations for reporting PMF results. BS-DISP and BS are found useful in understanding the uncertainty of factor profiles; they also suggest if the data are over-fitted by specifying too many factors. DISP diagnostics were consistently robust, indicating its use for understanding rotational uncertainty and as a first step in assessing a solution's viability. The uncertainty of each factor's identifying species is shown to be a useful gauge for evaluating multiple solutions, e.g., with a different number of factors.},

Methodologies to quantify ROS concentrations vary widely, both in detection and collection methods. However, there is currently an increasing emphasis on rapid collection and measurement due to observations of short half-life ROS. To address this problem, this paper details the design and characterization of a novel instrument for the measurement of PM-bound ROS named the Particle Into Nitroxide Quencher (PINQ). This instrument combines the 9,10-bis (phenylethynyl) anthracene-nitroxide (BPEAnit) ROS assay in conjunction with a purpose-built aerosol collection device, the insoluble aerosol collector (IAC). The IAC continuously collects PM regardless of size or chemistry directly into a liquid sample with a collection efficiency of {$>$} 0.97 and a cut-off size of {$<$} 20 nm. The sampling time resolution of the PINQ is 1 min, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.08 nmol m−3 in equivalent BPEAnit-Me concentration per volume of air. This high sample time resolution and sensitivity is achieved due to a combination of the highly concentrated IAC liquid sample, minimized liquid sample volume, and the rapid reaction and stability of the BPEAnit probe.},

  abstract = {Aerosols containing biological components can have a significant effect on human health by causing primarily irritation, infection and allergies. Specifically, airborne fungi can cause a wide array of adverse responses in humans depending on the type and quantity present. In this study we used chemical biomarkers for analyzing fungi-5 containing aerosols in the eastern Mediterranean region during the year 2009 in order to quantify annual fungal abundances. The prime marker for fungi used in this study was ergosterol, and its concentrations were compared with those of mannitol and ara-bitol, which were recently suggested to also correlate with fungal spores concentrations (Bauer et al., 2008a). Back trajectory analysis, inorganic ions, humidity and tempera-10 ture were used in an attempt to identify sources as well as the dependence on seasonal and environmental conditions. We found that the ambient concentrations of ergosterol, arabitol and mannitol range between 0 and 2.73 ng m −3 , 1.85 and 58.27 ng m −3 , 5.57 and 138.03 ng m −3 , respectively. The highest levels for all biomarkers were during the autumn, probably from local terrestrial sources, as deduced from the inorganic ions 15 and back trajectory analysis. Significant correlations were observed between arabitol and mannitol during the entire year except for the winter months. Both sugars correlated with ergosterol only during the spring and autumn. We conclude that mannitol and arabitol might not be specific biomarkers for fungi and that the observed correlations during spring and autumn may be attributed to high levels of vegetation during 20 spring blossoms and autumn decomposition.},

  abstract = {Receptor models are rarely utilized in atmospheric deposition but are often used to identify pollutant sources and quantify their contributions. This article focuses on the soil in atmospheric deposition in a typical polluted city. Atmospheric deposition has become an important route for exogenous heavy metals’ input into ecosystems. In this study, the heavy metals in atmospheric deposition were determined in three monitoring points arranged in Handan City. According to the functional area, fluxes, sources, and accumulation in the soil were explored. The sources of heavy metals were identified by PMF (positive matrix factorization) and UNMIX. The accumulation of heavy metals in the soil was predicted. The results showed that the deposition fluxes in industrial areas were higher than other functional areas. The mean concentrations of 8 heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn, and As) in the atmospheric deposition exceed their background values. PMF identified five major sources and UNMIX analyzed four sources. Similar source apportionment results were acquired               via               PMF and UNMIX, which were the combustion of fossil fuels, steel-smelting emission, road dust, and industrial sources. Steel-smelter emission was the highest source contributor. Therefore, combining these two models was the most effective approach, and more attention should be paid to mitigating the pollution caused by the industrial activities. The prediction indicated that the accumulation of heavy metals from atmospheric deposition to the soil would increase in 30~years, the growth rate of Cd increased significantly. The results of this study could provide reference in reduction of heavy metal pollution in atmospheric deposition.},

Oxidative potential (OP) of PM is increasingly studied as a relevant metric for health impact (instead of PM mass concentration) as much of the ambient particle mass do not contribute to PM toxicity. Several assays have been developed to quantify PM oxidative potential and a widely used one is the acellular dithiothreitol (DTT) assay. However in such assays, particles are usually extracted with methanol or Milli-Q water which is unrepresentative of physiological conditions. For this purpose, OPDTT measurements after simulated lung fluids (SLF) extraction, in order to look at the impact of simulated lung fluid constituents, were compared to Milli-Q water extraction measurements. Our major finding is a significant decrease of the OPDTT when the artificial lysosomal fluid (ALF) solution was used. Indeed, ligand compounds are present in the SLF solutions and some induce a decrease of the OP when compared to water extraction. Our results suggest that the effect of ligands and complexation in lining fluids towards PM contaminants probably has been underestimated and should be investigated further.},

Thus, assays have been developed to quantify the oxidative potential (OP) of PM as a more refined exposure metric than PM mass alone. Only a small number of studies have compared different acellular OP measurements for a given set of ambient PM samples. Yet, fewer studies have compared different assays over a year-long period and with detailed chemical characterization of ambient PM. In this study, we report on seasonal variations of the dithiothreitol (DTT), ascorbic acid (AA), electron spin resonance (ESR) and the respiratory tract lining fluid (RTLF, composed of the reduced glutathione (GSH) and ascorbic acid (ASC)) assays over a 1-year period in which 100 samples were analyzed. A detailed PM10 characterization allowed univariate and multivariate regression analyses in order to obtain further insight into groups of chemical species that drive OP measurements. Our results show that most of the OP assays were strongly intercorrelated over the sampling year but also these correlations differed when considering specific sampling periods (cold vs. warm). All acellular assays are correlated with a significant number of chemical species when considering univariate correlations, especially for the DTT assay. Evidence is also presented of a seasonal contrast over the sampling period with significantly higher OP values during winter for the DTT, AA, GSH and ASC assays, which were assigned to biomass burning species by the multiple linear regression models. The ESR assay clearly differs from the other tests as it did not show seasonal dynamics and presented weaker correlations with other assays and chemical species.},

A remarkable homogeneity in annual cycles was observed with a higher OP activity in wintertime at all investigated sites. Univariate correlations were used to link the concentrations of some major chemical components of PM and their OP. Four PM components were identified as OP predictors: OC, EC, monosaccharides and Cu. These species are notably emitted by road transport and biomass burning, targeting main sources probably responsible for the measured OP activity. The results obtained confirm that the relationship between OP and atmospheric pollutants is assay- and location-dependent and, thus, the strong need for a standardized test, or set of tests, for further regulation purposes.},

  abstract = {Source apportionment models were widely used to successfully assign highly time-resolved aerosol data to specific emissions and/or atmospheric chemical processes. These techniques are necessary for targeting the sources affecting air quality and for designing effective mitigation strategies. Moreover, evaluation of the toxicity of airborne particulate matter is important since the classically measured particulate matter (PM) concentrations appear insufficient for characterizing the impact on human health. Oxidative potential (OP) measurement has recently been developed to quantify the capability of PM to induce an oxidative imbalance in the lungs. As a result, this measurement unit could be a better proxy than PM mass concentration to represent PM toxicity. In the present study, two source apportionment analyses were performed using positive matrix factorization (PMF) from organic aerosol (OA) mass spectra measured at a 15 min time resolution using a time-of-flight aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ToF-ACSM) and from 19 trace elements measured on an hourly basis using an online metal analyser (Xact 625i). The field measurements were carried out in summer 2018. While it is common to perform PMF studies individually on ACSMs and more recently on Xact datasets, here we used a two-step methodology leading to a complete PM1 source apportionment. The outputs from both OA PMF and Xact PMF, the inorganic species concentrations from the ACSM, and the black carbon (BC) fractions (fossil fuel and wood burning) measured using an Aethalometer (AE33) were gathered into a single dataset and subjected to a combined PMF analysis. Overall, eight factors were identified, each of them corresponding to a more precise source than performing single PMF analyses. The results show that besides the high contribution of secondary ammonium sulfate (28 \%) and organic nitrate (19 \%), about 50 \% of PM1 originated from distinct combustion sources, including emissions from traffic, shipping, industrial activities, cooking, and biomass burning. Simultaneously, PM1 filters were collected during the experimental period on a 4 h sampling basis. On these filters, two acellular OP assays were performed (dithiothreitol; OPDTT and ascorbic acid; OPAA) and an inversion method was applied on factors issued from all PMFs to assess the contribution of the PM sources to the OP. This work highlights the sensitivity of OPAA to industrial and dust resuspension sources and those of OPDTT to secondary ammonium sulfate, shipping, and biomass burning.},

A graphical user interface SoFi (Source Finder) was developed at PSI in order to facilitate the testing of different rotational techniques available within the ME-2 engine by providing a priori factor profiles for some or all of the expected factors. ME-2 was used to test the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model, the fully constrained chemical mass balance (CMB) model, and partially constrained models utilizing \emph{a} values and pulling equations. Within the set of model solutions determined to be environmentally reasonable, BBOA and SV-OOA factor mass spectra and time series showed the greatest variability. This variability represents the uncertainty in the model solution and indicates that analysis of model rotations provides a useful approach for assessing the uncertainty of bilinear source apportionment models. © 2013 Author(s).},

Many previous studies using this or related instruments have utilized the fraction of organic mass measured at m/z44 (f44), which is typically dominated by the CO2+ ion and related to oxygenation, as an indicator of atmospheric aging. The current study demonstrates that during summer afternoons, when photochemical processes are most vigorous as indicated by high oxidant - OX (O3 + NO2), f44 for ambient secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is not higher but is rather similar or lower than on days with low OX. On the other hand, f43 (less oxidized fragment) tends to increase. These changes are discussed in the f44/f43 space frequently used to interpret ACSM and aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) data. This is likely due to the formation of semi-volatile oxygenated aerosol produced from biogenic precursor gases, whose emissions increase with ambient temperature. In addition, source apportionment analyses conducted on winter and summer data using positive matrix factorization (PMF) yield semi-volatile oxygenated organic aerosol (SV-OOA) factors that retain source-related chemical information. Winter SV-OOA is highly influenced by biomass burning, whereas summer SV-OOA is to a high degree produced from biogenic precursor gases. These sources contribute to substantial differences between the winter and summer f44/f43 data, suggesting that PMF analysis of multi-season data employing only two OOA factors cannot capture the seasonal variability of OOA.},

The paper reports on the daily evolution of the main aerosol chemical characteristics as a function of particle size in different environments over the Italian Peninsula, spanning from the Po Valley to the south Tyrrhenian coast. Two 4-day intensive observation periods (IOPs) were undertaken in July 2007 and February 2008, under meteorological conditions typical of the summer and winter climate for Italy. In the summer IOP, under stable atmospheric conditions, at the low-altitude continental sites the diurnal evolution of the planetary boundary layer (PBL), induces an atmospheric dilution effect driving the particulate matter (PM) concentrations, while, at the mountain site, it determines the upward motion of polluted air masses from the Po Valley PBL in daytime.The fine fraction was dominated by ammonium salts and carbonaceous matter (water-soluble organic matter, WSOM, and water-insoluble carbonaceous matter, WINCM). High concentrations of ammonium sulphate and WSOM due to enhanced photochemical activity constituted the background aerosol composition over the whole country, whereas, ammonium nitrate and WINCM were more associated to local emissions (e.g. urban site with concentrations peaking in the finest size range due to strong local traffic-related sources of ultrafine particles).During the winter IOP in the Po Valley, the shallow PBL depths and low wind velocity, especially at night, favoured the condensation of semi-volatile species (i.e. organic matter and ammonium nitrate), causing the high fine PM concentration observed at ground level. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Recent field and laboratory evidence indicates that the oxidation of isoprene, (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene, C5H8) forms secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Global biogenic emissions of isoprene (600 Tg yr−1) are sufficiently large that the formation of SOA in even small yields results in substantial production of atmospheric particulate matter, likely having implications for air quality and climate. Here we present a review of field measurements, experimental work, and modeling studies aimed at understanding the mechanisms, yield, and atmospheric importance of isoprene-derived SOA. SOA yields depend on a number of factors, including organic aerosol loading (Mo), NOx level (RO2 chemistry), and, because of the importance of multigenerational chemistry, the degree of oxidation. These dependences are not always included in SOA modules used in atmospheric transport models, and instead most yield parameterizations rely on a single set of chamber experiments (carried out over a limited range of conditions); this may lead to very different estimates of the atmospheric importance of isoprene SOA. New yield parameterizations, based on all available laboratory data (Mo=0–50 µg m−3), are presented here, so that SOA formation may be computed as a function of Mo, NOx level, and temperature. Current research needs and future research directions are identified.},

The analysis is focused on both historical series and future projections under climate change. Historical sounding data from two different Italian stations are used as well as future projections data, provided by CMCC-CCLM 4-8-19 regional climate model (MED-CORDEX initiative). A new method to detect layers of temperature inversion is also presented. The developed method computes the occurrence of a temperature inversion layer for a given day at 12 UTC without a detailed knowledge of temperature vertical profile. This method was validated using sounding data and applied to the model projections, under two different emissions scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Under RCP4.5 intermediate emissions scenario, the occurrence of temperature inversions is projected to increase by 12 days/year (around + 10\%) in the last decade of 21st century compared to 1986–2005 average. However, the increase in temperature inversions seems to be especially concentrated in the warm period. Under RCP8.5 extreme scenario, temperature inversions are still projected to increase, though to a lesser extent compared to RCP4.5 scenario (+ 6 days/year in the last decade of 21st century). A similar trend was found also for air stagnation events, which take into account the variation of precipitation pattern and wind strength. The expected increases are equal to + 13 days/year and + 11 days/year in the last decade of 21st century compared to 1986–2005 average, under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios respectively.},

  abstract = {Particulate matter (PM) is regulated in various parts of the world based on specific size cut offs, often expressed as 10 or 2.5 mm mass median aerodynamic diameter. This pollutant is deemed one of the most dangerous to health and moreover, problems persist with high ambient concentrations. Continuing pressure to re-evaluate ambient air quality standards stems from research that not only has identified effects at low levels of PM but which also has revealed that reductions in certain components, sources and size fractions may best protect public health. Considerable amount of published information have emerged from toxicological research in recent years. Accumulating evidence has identified additional air quality metrics (e.g. black carbon, secondary organic and inorganic aerosols) that may be valuable in evaluating the health risks of, for example, primary combustion particles from traffic emissions, which are not fully taken into account with PM2.5 mass. Most of the evidence accumulated so far is for an adverse effect on health of carbonaceous material from traffic. Traffic-generated dust, including road, brake and tire wear, also contribute to the adverse effects on health. Exposure durations from a few minutes up to a year have been linked with adverse effects. The new evidence collected supports the scientific conclusions of the World Health Organization Air Quality Guidelines and also provides scientific arguments for taking decisive actions to improve air quality and reduce the global burden of disease associated with air pollution.},

  abstract = {Source apportionment of aerosol is an important approach to investigate aerosol formation and transformation processes as well as to assess appropriate mitigation strategies and to investigate causes of non-compliance with air quality standards (Directive 2008/50/CE). Receptor models (RMs) based on chemical composition of aerosol measured at specific sites are a useful, and widely used, tool to perform source apportionment. However, an analysis of available studies in the scientific literature reveals heterogeneities in the approaches used, in terms of “working variables” such as the number of samples in the dataset and the number of chemical species used as well as in the modeling tools used. In this work, an inter-comparison of PM10 source apportionment results obtained at three European measurement sites is presented, using two receptor models: principal component analysis coupled with multi-linear regression analysis (PCA-MLRA) and positive matrix factorization (PMF). The inter-comparison focuses on source identification, quantification of source contribution to PM10, robustness of the results, and how these are influenced by the number of chemical species available in the datasets. Results show very similar component/factor profiles identified by PCA and PMF, with some discrepancies in the number of factors. The PMF model appears to be more suitable to separate secondary sulfate and secondary nitrate with respect to PCA at least in the datasets analyzed. Further, some difficulties have been observed with PCA in separating industrial and heavy oil combustion contributions. Commonly at all sites, the crustal contributions found with PCA were larger than those found with PMF, and the secondary inorganic aerosol contributions found by PCA were lower than those found by PMF. Site-dependent differences were also observed for traffic and marine contributions. The inter-comparison of source apportionment performed on complete datasets (using the full range of available chemical species) and incomplete datasets (with reduced number of chemical species) allowed to investigate the sensitivity of source apportionment (SA) results to the working variables used in the RMs. Results show that, at both sites, the profiles and the contributions of the different sources calculated with PMF are comparable within the estimated uncertainties indicating a good stability and robustness of PMF results. In contrast, PCA outputs are more sensitive to the chemical species present in the datasets. In PCA, the crustal contributions are higher in the incomplete datasets and the traffic contributions are significantly lower for incomplete datasets.},

  abstract = {Receptor models (RMs), based on chemical composition of particulate matter (PM), such as Chemical Mass Balance (CMB) and Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF), represent useful tools for determining the impact of PM sources to air quality. This information is useful, especially in areas influenced by anthropogenic activities, to plan mitigation strategies for environmental management. Recent inter-comparison of source apportionment (SA) results showed that one of the difficulties in the comparison of estimated source contributions is the compatibility of the sources, i.e. the chemical profiles of factor/sources used in receptor models. This suggests that SA based on integration of several RMs could give more stable and reliable solutions with respect to a single model. The aim of this work was to perform inter-comparison of PMF (using PMF3.0 and PMF5.0 codes) and CMB outputs, focusing on both source chemical profiles and estimates of source contributions. The dataset included 347 daily PM10 samples collected in three sites in central Italy located near industrial emissions. Samples were chemically analysed for the concentrations of 21 chemical species (NH4+, Ca2~+, Mg2~+, Na+, K+, Mg2~+, SO42~−, NO3−, Cl−, Si, Al, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Br, EC, and OC) used as input of RMs. The approach identified 9 factor/sources: marine, traffic, resuspended dust, biomass burning, secondary sulphate, secondary nitrate, crustal, coal combustion power plant and harbour-industrial. Results showed that the application of constraints in PMF5.0 improved interpretability of profiles and comparability of estimated source contributions with stoichiometric calculations. The inter-comparison of PMF and CMB gave significant differences for secondary nitrate, biomass burning, and harbour-industrial sources, due to non-compatibility of these source profiles that have local specificities. When these site-dependent specificities were taken into account, optimising the input source profiles of CMB, a significant improvement in the comparison of the estimated source contributions with PMF was obtained.},

Several works have focused on characterisation of source contributions to PM OP, mainly using three approaches: correlation between OP and chemical markers of specific sources; use of OP as input variable in source apportionment with receptor models; and multi-linear regression (MLR) between OP and source contributions to PM obtained from receptor models. Up to now, comparison of results obtained with different approaches on the same dataset is scarce. This work aims to perform a OP study of PM2.5 collected in an industrial site, located near a biogas production and combustion plant (in southern Italy), comparing different approaches to investigate the contributions of the different sources to OP. The PM2.5 samples were analysed for determining ions, metals, carbonaceous components, and OP activity with the DTT (dithiotreitol) assay. Results showed that OP normalised in volume (DTTV) is correlated with carbonaceous components and some ions (NO3-, and Ca2+) indicating thatPMof combustion, secondary, and crustal origin could contribute to the OP activity. The source apportionment, done with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF5.0) model, identified six sources: secondary sulphate; biomass burning; industrial emissions; crustal; vehicle traffic and secondary nitrate; and sea spray. A MLR analysis between the source's daily contributions and the daily DTTV values showed a reasonable agreement of the two approaches (PMF and MLR), identifying the biomass burning and the vehicle traffic and secondary nitrate as the main sources contributing to DTTV activity.},

The combined use of aerosol, VOC, main gaseous pollutants composition data and wind data resulted in better values of statistical indicators and diagnostic plots, and source factors which could be more easily related to known sources. The number of source factors resolved was similar to those reported in the literature where larger data sets were used. Three source factors were identified for the coarse particle samples, including ‘crustal matter’, ‘vehicle emissions’ and ‘sea spray’. Seven source factors were identified for the fine particle and VOC samples, including ‘secondary and biogenic’, ‘petroleum refining’, ‘vehicle emissions’, ‘petroleum product wholesaling’, ‘evaporative emissions’, ‘sea spray’ and ‘crustal matter’. The factor loadings of the 16 wind sectors and the calm wind sector from the PMF analysis were also used to quantify the directional contribution of the source factors. While the contributions were higher in the prevailing wind directions as expected, calm winds were also found to contribute up to 17\% of the pollutant mass on average. The factor loadings, normalised by the overall abundance of the wind sectors, were also used to assess the directional dependences of the source factors. The results matched well with the location of known sources in the area. There was also a higher contribution potential from calm winds for local sources compared to that for distant sources. The results of directional effect using the PMF factor loading approach were similar to those by using the other approaches. This approach, however, also provides estimates of the mass contribution of source factors by wind sector and also the uncertainty of the results.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Atmospheric trace elements, especially metal species, are an emerging environmental and health concern with insufficient understanding of their levels and sources in Shanghai, the most important industrial megacity in China. Here we continuously performed a 1~year (from March~2016 to February~2017) and hourly resolved measurement of 18 elements in fine particles (PM2.5) at the Shanghai urban center with an Xact multi-metals monitor and several collocated instruments. Mass concentrations (mean\,±\,1σ; ng\,m−3) determined by Xact ranged from detection limits (nominally 0.1 to 20\,ng\,m−3) to 15\,µg\,m−3. Element-related oxidized species comprised an appreciable fraction of PM2.5 during all seasons, accounting for 8.3\,\% on average. As a comparison, the atmospheric elements concentration level in Shanghai was comparable with that in other industrialized cities in East Asia but 1 or 2 orders of magnitude higher than at sites in North America and Europe. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) was applied to identify and apportion the sources of the elements in the PM2.5 mass. Five different factors were resolved (notable elements and relative contribution in parentheses): traffic-related (Ca, Fe, Ba, Si; 46\,\%), shipping (V, Ni; 6\,\%), nonferrous metal smelting (Ag, Cd, Au; 15\,\%), coal combustion (As, Se, Hg, Pb; 18\,\%) and ferrous metal smelting (Cr, Mn, Zn; 15\,\%). The contribution from the exhaust and non-exhaust vehicle emissions, i.e., the traffic-related factor shows a strong bimodal diurnal profile with average concentration over 2~times higher during the rush hour than during nighttime. The shipping factor was firmly identified because V and Ni, two recognized tracers of shipping emissions, are almost exclusively transported from the East China Sea and their ratio (around 3.2) falls within the variation range of V\,∕\,Ni ratios in particles emitted from heavy oil combustion. Interestingly, nearly half of the K was derived from coal combustion with high mineral affinity (elements associated with aluminosilicates, carbonates and other minerals in coal ash). The contributions of nonferrous metal smelting to the trace elements are consistent with a newly developed emission inventory. Although the precipitation scavenging effect on the mass concentration of the trace elements varied among different species and sources, precipitation could effectively lower the concentration of the traffic- and coal combustion-related trace elements. Therefore, water spray to simulate natural types of precipitation could be one of the abatement strategies to facilitate the reduction of ambient PM2.5 trace elements in the urban atmosphere. Collectively, our findings in this study provide baseline levels and sources of trace elements with high detail, which are needed for developing effective control strategies to reduce the high risk of acute exposure to atmospheric trace elements in China's megacities.},

Elemental carbon, brakewear metals (Cu, Fe, Sb, Sn, Mn), n-alkanes (C19-C26), light-molecular-weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs; pyrene, fluoranthene, anthracene) and two hopanes (17α21βnorhopane and 17α21βhopane) are strongly associated with the road traffic. Traffic-fleet emission factors have been determined for all of them and are consistent with most recent published equivalent data. When possible, lightduty-and heavy-duty-traffic emission factors are also determined. In the absence of significant non-combustion emissions, light-duty-traffic emissions are in good agreement with emissions from chassis dynamometer measurements. Since recent measurements in Europe including those from this study are consistent, ratios involving copper (Cu=Fe and Cu=Sn) could be used as brake-wear emissions tracers as long as brakes with Cu remain in use. Near the Grenoble ring road, where the traffic was largely dominated by diesel vehicles in 2011 (70 \%), the OC=EC ratio estimated for traffic emissions was around 0.4. Although the use of quantitative data for source apportionment studies is not straightforward for the identified organic molecular markers, their presence seems to well-characterize fresh traffic emissions.},

This study reports results of PM1 chemical composition determined using a Time-of-Flight Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ToF-ACSM) over a 14-month period (1~February~2017–13~April~2018) at the Marseille–Longchamp supersite (MRS-LCP) in France. Parallel measurements were performed with an aethalometer, an ultrafine particle monitor and a suite of instruments to monitor regulated pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NOx, O3 and SO2). The average PM1 chemical composition over the period was dominated by organic aerosol (OA; 49.7\,\%) and black carbon (BC; 17.1\,\%), while sulfate accounted for 14.6\,\%, nitrate for 10.2\,\%, ammonium for 7.9\,\% and chloride for 0.5\,\% only. Wintertime was found to be the season contributing the most to the annual PM1 mass concentration (30\,\%), followed by autumn (26\,\%), summer (24\,\%) and spring (20\,\%). During this season, OA and BC concentrations were found to contribute 32\,\% and 31\,\% of their annual concentrations, respectively, as a combined result of heavy urban traffic, high emissions from residential heating and low planetary boundary layer (PBL) height. Most (75\,\%) of the 15 days exceeding the target daily PM2.5 concentration value recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) occurred during this season. Local and long-range pollution episodes with contrasting chemical composition could be distinguished, accounting for 40\,\% and 60\,\% of the exceedance days, respectively. Enhanced OA and BC concentrations, mostly originating from domestic wood burning under nocturnal land breeze conditions, were observed during local pollution episodes, while high levels of oxygenated OA and inorganic nitrate were associated with medium-/long-range transported particles. In summertime, substantially higher concentrations of sulfate were found, with an average and a maximum contribution to the PM1 mass of 24\,\% and 66\,\%, respectively. Results from k-means clustering analysis of daily profiles of sulfate concentrations clearly reveal the significant influence of local harbour/industrial activities on air quality in addition to the more regional contribution of shipping traffic that originates from the Mediterranean basin.},

  abstract = {We investigated the contributions and the evolution of organic aerosol (OA) sources at the Marseille-Longchamp supersite (MRS-LCP, France) based on Time-of-flight Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ToF-ACSM) measurements of non-refractory PM1 over a fourteen-month period (1 February – 3 April 2018). The OA source apportionment was performed by positive matrix factorization (PMF) using the novel “rolling window” approach implemented in the Source Finder Professional (SoFi Pro). Here, PMF is performed over a 14-days window moving over the entire OA dataset, in order to account for the temporal variability of the source profiles. Six factors were resolved, including hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol (HOA) which is related to traffic exhausts, cooking-like organic aerosol (COA), biomass burning aerosol (BBOA), less oxidized organic aerosol (LOOA), more oxidized organic aerosol (MOOA) and a new defined source related to the mix between shipping and industrial plumes (Sh-IndOA). While HOA and COA consistently contribute to the total OA with on average 11.2\% (ranging between 9.2 and 12.1\% over the seasons) and 11.5\% (11–12.1\%), respectively, BBOA (11.7\% on average) shows a larger seasonal variability with 18\% in winter and no contribution in summer. BBOA profiles during winter were attributed to fresh biomass burning emissions from domestic heating, and more oxygenated profiles were assigned to regional land and agricultural waste burning for spring and early autumn. Sh-IndOA fraction is estimated to 4.5\% (3.7–6.1\%) and contributes to the total OA mass concentrations to a minor extent. The secondary organic aerosol (SOA) fraction includes both LOOA with 21.5\% (18.8–27.2\%) and MOOA with 39.6\% (36.8–42.6\%). Based on the f44/f43 analysis these sources appeared to be more linked to biogenic influences in summer, whereas the concentrations were associated with oxidized anthropogenic sources (biomass burning and road traffic) for the rest of the year. The investigation of MOOA geographical origins suggests some influence of air masses transported from the Rhoˆne Valley and the west basin of the Mediterranean Sea.},

  abstract = {This study presents the first long-term online measurements of submicron (PM1) particles at the ATOLL (ATmospheric Observations in liLLe) platform, in northern France. The ongoing measurements using an Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM) started at the end of 2016 and the analysis presented here spans through December 2020. At this site, the mean PM1 concentration is 10.6 μg m 3, dominated by organic aerosols (OA, 42.3\%) and followed by nitrate (28.9\%), ammonium (12.3\%), sulfate (8.6\%), and black carbon (BC, 8.0\%). Large seasonal variations of PM1 concentrations are observed, with high concentrations during cold seasons, associated with pollution episodes (e.g. over 100 μg m 3 in January 2017). To study OA origins over this multiannual dataset we performed source apportionment analysis using rolling positive matrix factorization (PMF), yielding two primary OA factors, a traffic-related hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA) and biomass-burning OA (BBOA), and two oxygenated OA (OOA) factors. HOA showed a homogeneous contribution to OA throughout the seasons (11.8\%), while BBOA varied from 8.1\% (summer) to 18.5\% (winter), the latter associated with residential wood combustion. The OOA factors were distinguished between their less and more oxidized fractions (LO-OOA and MOOOA, on average contributing 32\% and 42\%, respectively). During winter, LO-OOA is identified as aged biomass burning, so at least half of OA is associated with wood combustion during this season. Furthermore, ammonium nitrate is also a predominant aerosol component during cold-weather pollution episodes – associated with fertilizer usage and traffic emissions. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of submicron aerosol sources at the recently established ATOLL site in northern France from multiannual observations, depicting a complex interaction between anthropogenic and natural sources, leading to different mechanisms of air quality degradation in the region across different seasons.},

  abstract = {Abstract. This paper presents a first comprehensive analysis of long-term measurements of atmospheric aerosol components from aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM) and multiwavelength Aethalometer (AE33) instruments collected between 2015 and 2021 at 13 (sub)urban sites as part of the French CARA (Chemical Characterization of Particles) program. The datasets contain the mass concentrations of major chemical species within submicron aerosols (PM1), namely organic aerosols (OAs), nitrate (NO3-), ammonium (NH4+), sulfate (SO42-), non-sea-salt chloride (Cl−), and equivalent black carbon (eBC). Rigorous quality control, technical validation, and environmental evaluation processes were applied, adhering to both guidance from the French Reference Laboratory for Air Quality Monitoring (LCSQA) and the Aerosol, Clouds, and Trace Gases Research Infrastructure (ACTRIS) standard operating procedures. Key findings include geographical differences in the aerosol chemical composition, seasonal variations, and diel patterns, which are influenced by meteorological conditions, anthropogenic activities, and proximity to emission sources. Overall, OA dominates PM1 at each site (43\,\%–60\,\% of total mass), showing distinct seasonality with higher concentrations (i)~in winter, due to enhanced residential heating emissions, and (ii)~in summer, due to increased photochemistry favoring secondary aerosol formation. NO3 is the second most important contributor to PM1 (15\,\%–30\,\%), peaking in late winter and early spring, especially in northern France, and playing a significant role during pollution episodes. SO4 (8\,\%–14\,\%) and eBC (5\,\%–11\,\%) complement the major fine-aerosol species, with their relative contributions strongly influenced by the origin of air masses and the stability of meteorological conditions, respectively. A comparison with the 3D chemical transport model (CTM) CHIMERE shows high correlations between simulations and measurements, albeit with an OA concentration underestimation of 46\,\%–76\,\%. Regional discrepancies in NO3 concentration levels emphasize the importance of these datasets with respect to validating air quality models and tailoring air pollution mitigation strategies.

  abstract = {Carbonyl compounds are important intermediates in atmospheric photochemistry. To explore the relative contributions of primary and secondary carbonyl sources, carbonyls and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were measured at an urban site in both winter and summer in Beijing. The positive matrix factorization (PMF) model was used for source apportionment of VOCs. As VOCs undergo photochemical processes in the atmosphere, and such processes may interfere with factor identification, the relationships between the contributions of the resolved PMF factors to each non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) species and its kOH value were used to distinguish fresh factors and photochemically aged factors. As the result of PMF, five factors were resolved in winter, and two of them were identified as photochemically aged emissions. In summer, four factors were resolved, including one aged factor. Carbonyls abundances from aged factors were simulated by VOCs consumption and the corresponding carbonyl production yields, and the simulated abundances agreed well with the results obtained by the PMF model. The source apportionment results indicated that secondary formation was the major source of carbonyls in both winter and summer, with the respective contributions of 51.2 \% and 46.0 \%. For the three major carbonyl species, primary anthropogenic sources contributed 28.9 \% and 32.3 \% to ambient formaldehyde, 53.7 \% and 41.6 \% to acetaldehyde, 68.1 \% and 56.2 \% to acetone in winter and summer, respectively.},

However, there is a paucity of data regarding the long-term effects of particulate matter (PM) on lung function among the elderly. This study evaluated the exposure-response relationship between ambient PM and different lung function indices among the elderly in Taiwan. A cross-sectional survey of individuals aged ≥65 years was conducted in Taiwan from October 2015 to September 2016. Those who attended the annual health examination for the elderly in five hospitals of varying background PM concentrations were enrolled. The long-term (2015 annual mean concentration) exposure to air pollution was estimated by the Kriging method at the residence of each subject. The association between ambient PM exposure and lung function was evaluated by linear regression modeling, with adjustments for age, sex, height, weight, educational attainment, presence of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking status, season, and co-pollutants. There were 1241 subjects (mean age, 70.5 years). The mean residential PM               2.5               and PM               2.5–10               in 2015 was 26.02 and 18.01\,μg/m               3               , respectively. After adjustments for confounders and co-pollutants, the FVC decrease was best associated with fine particles (PM               2.5               ), whereas the FEV               1               , FEF               25–75\%               , FEF               25\%               and FEF               50\%               decreases were best associated with coarse particles (PM               2.5–10               ). An IQR (10\,μg/m               3               ) increase in PM               2.5               decreased FVC by 106.38\,ml (4.47\%), while an IQR (7.29\,μg/m               3               ) increase in PM               2.5–10               decreased FEV               1               and FEF               25–75\%               by 91.23\,ml (4.85\%) and 104.44\,ml/s (5.58\%), respectively. Among the Taiwanese elderly, long-term PM               2.5               exposure mainly decreases the vital capacity of lung function. Moreover, PM               2.5–10               has a stronger negative effect on the function of conductive airways than PM               2.5               .},

  abstract = {Abstract. We collected 1~year of aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM) data in Magadino, a village located in the south of the Swiss Alpine region, one of Switzerland's most polluted areas. We analysed the mass spectra of organic aerosol (OA) by positive matrix factorisation (PMF) using Source Finder Professional (SoFi Pro) to retrieve the origins of OA. Therein, we deployed a rolling algorithm, which is closer to the measurement, to account for the temporal changes in the source profiles. As the first-ever application of rolling PMF with multilinear engine (ME-2) analysis on a yearlong dataset that was collected from a rural site, we resolved two primary OA factors (traffic-related hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA) and biomass burning OA (BBOA)), one mass-to-charge ratio (m/z)~58-related OA (58-OA) factor, a less oxidised oxygenated OA (LO-OOA) factor, and a more oxidised oxygenated OA (MO-OOA) factor. HOA showed stable contributions to the total OA through the whole year ranging from 8.1\,\% to 10.1\,\%, while the contribution of BBOA showed an apparent seasonal variation with a range of 8.3\,\%–27.4\,\% (highest during winter, lowest during summer) and a yearly average of 17.1\,\%. OOA (sum of LO-OOA and MO-OOA) contributed 71.6\,\% of the OA mass, varying from 62.5\,\% (in winter) to 78\,\% (in spring and summer). The 58-OA factor mainly contained nitrogen-related variables which appeared to be pronounced only after the filament switched. However, since the contribution of this factor was insignificant (2.1\,\%), we did not attempt to interpolate its potential source in this work. The uncertainties (σ) for the modelled OA factors (i.e. rotational uncertainty and statistical variability in the sources) varied from ±4\,\% (58-OA) to a maximum of ±40\,\% (LO-OOA). Considering that BBOA and LO-OOA (showing influences of biomass burning in winter) had significant contributions to the total OA mass, we suggest reducing and controlling biomass-burning-related residential heating as a mitigation strategy for better air quality and lower PM levels in this region or similar locations. In Appendix~A, we conduct a head-to-head comparison between the conventional seasonal PMF analysis and the rolling mechanism. We find similar or slightly improved results in terms of mass concentrations, correlations with external tracers, and factor profiles of the constrained POA factors. The rolling results show smaller scaled residuals and enhanced correlations between OOA factors and corresponding inorganic salts compared to those of the seasonal solutions, which was most likely because the rolling PMF analysis can capture the temporal variations in the oxidation processes for OOA components. Specifically, the time-dependent factor profiles of MO-OOA and LO-OOA can well explain the temporal viabilities of two main ions for OOA factors, m/z~44 (CO2+) and m/z~43 (mostly C2H3O+). Therefore, this rolling PMF analysis provides a more realistic source apportionment (SA) solution with time-dependent OA sources. The rolling results also show good agreement with offline Aerodyne aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) SA results from filter samples, except for in winter. The latter discrepancy is likely because the online measurement can capture the fast oxidation processes of biomass burning sources, in contrast to the 24\,h filter samples. This study demonstrates the strengths of the rolling mechanism, provides a comprehensive criterion list for ACSM users to obtain reproducible SA results, and is a role model for similar analyses of such worldwide available data.},

  abstract = {Toxicological studies have demonstrated the associations between fine particle (PM2.5) components and various cytotoxic endpoints. However, few studies have investigated the toxicological eff ects of sourcespecific PM2.5 at the individual level. To investigate the potential impact of source-specific PM2.5 on cytotoxic effects, we performed repeated personal PM2.5 monitoring of 48 adult participants in Hong Kong during the winter and summer of 2014e2015. Quartz filters were analyzed for carbonaceous aerosols and water-soluble ions in PM2.5. Teflon filters were collected to determine personal PM2.5 mass and metal concentrations. The toxicological effects of personal PM2.5 exposuredincluding cytotoxicity, inflammatory response, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) productiondwere measured using A549 cells in vitro. Personal PM2.5 samples collected in winter were more effective than those collected in summer at inducing cytotoxicity and the expression of proinflammation cytokine IL-6. By contrast, summer personal PM2.5 samples induced high ROS production. We performed a series of statistical analyses, Spearman correlation and a source apportionment approach with a multiple linear regression (MLR) model, to explore the sources contributing most significantly to personal PM2.5 bioreactivity. Secondary inorganic species and transition metals were discovered to be weak-to-moderately associated with cytotoxicity (rs: 0.26e0.55; p {$<$} 0.01) and inflammatory response (rs: 0.26e0.44; p {$<$} 0.05), respectively. Carbonaceous aerosols (i.e., organic and elemental carbon; rs: 0.23e0.27; p {$<$} 0.05) and crustal material (Mg and Ca) was positively associated with ROS generation. The PMFeMLR models revealed that tailpipe exhaust and secondary sulfate contributed to ROS generation, whereas secondary nitrate was the major contributor to PM2.5 cytotoxicity and inflammation. These results improve and variate the arguments for practical policies designed to mitigate the risks posed by air pollution sources and to protect public health.},

  abstract = {Organic aerosol (OA) is a key component of total submicron particulate matter (PM1), and comprehensive knowledge of OA sources across Europe is crucial to mitigate PM1 levels. Europe has a well-established air quality research infrastructure from which yearlong datasets using 21 aerosol chemical speciation monitors (ACSMs) and 1 aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) were gathered during 2013–2019. It includes 9 non-urban and 13 urban sites. This study developed a state-of-the-art source apportionment protocol to analyse long-term OA mass spectrum data by applying the most advanced source apportionment strategies (i.e., rolling PMF, ME-2, and bootstrap). This harmonised protocol was followed strictly for all 22 datasets, making the source apportionment results more comparable. In addition, it enables quantification of the most common OA components such as hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), biomass burning OA (BBOA), cooking-like OA (COA), more oxidised-oxygenated OA (MO-OOA), and less oxidised-oxygenated OA (LO-OOA). Other components such as coal combustion OA (CCOA), solid fuel OA (SFOA: mainly mixture of coal and peat combustion), cigarette smoke OA (CSOA), sea salt (mostly inorganic but part of the OA mass spectrum), coffee OA, and ship industry OA could also be separated at a few specific sites. Oxygenated OA (OOA) components make up most of the submicron OA mass (average = 71.1\%, range from 43.7 to 100\%). Solid fuel combustion-related OA components (i.e., BBOA, CCOA, and SFOA) are still considerable with in total 16.0\% yearly contribution to the OA, yet mainly during winter months (21.4\%). Overall, this comprehensive protocol works effectively across all sites governed by different sources and generates robust and consistent source apportionment results. Our work presents a comprehensive overview of OA sources in Europe with a unique combination of high time resolution (30–240 min) and long-term data coverage (9–36 months), providing essential information to improve/validate air quality, health impact, and climate models.},

However, one of the issues with ambient air pollution data used in those analyses is that the concentrations result from a combination of emission/formation rates and meteorological dispersion. Dispersion normalized PMF (DN-PMF) was recently developed to reduce the influence of dilution on source resolution. Studies have shown its capability to better reflect actual emission rates and yield more interpretable results for hourly integrated ambient data for particulate matter and particle number size distributions. In this study, conventional and DN-PMF were used to deconvolute long-term 24-h integrated speciated PM2.5 data sets, for the first time, for three urban sites in the NYC metropolitan area. DN-PMF using 24-h integrated data does not provide much improvement over DN-PMF using hourly integrated data since averaging over 24 h loses the strong diel dispersion patterns. However, it provides improved seasonal patterns for different sources that are lost with conventional PMF results. DN-PMF implements necessary corrections to the conventional PMF approach, and makes better use of the chemical monitoring data that generally have lower time resolution.},

This study investigated the relationships between levoglucosan and other biomass burning tracers (i.e., water soluble potassium and mannosan) based on both ambient samples collected in Beijing and source samples. Compared with North America and Europe, Beijing was characterized by high ambient levoglucosan concentrations and low winter to summer ratios of levoglucosan, indicating significant impact of biomass burning activities throughout the year in Beijing. Comparison of levoglucosan and water soluble potassium (K+) levels suggested that it was acceptable to use K+ as a biomass burning tracer during summer in Beijing, while the contribution of fireworks to K + could be significant during winter. Moreover, the levoglucosan to K+ ratio was found to be lower during the typical summer period (0.21 ± 0.16) compared with the typical winter period (0.51 ± 0.15). Levoglucosan correlated strongly with mannosan (R2 = 0.97) throughout the winter and the levoglucosan to mannosan ratio averaged 9.49 ± 1.63, whereas levoglucosan and mannosan exhibited relatively weak correlation (R 2 = 0.73) during the typical summer period when the levoglucosan to mannosan ratio averaged 12.65 ± 3.38. Results from positive matrix factorization (PMF) model analysis showed that about 50\% of the OC and EC in Beijing were associated with biomass burning processes. In addition, a new source identification method was developed based on the comparison of the levoglucosan to K+ ratio and the levoglucosan to mannosan ratio among different types of biomass. Using this method, the major source of biomass burning aerosol in Beijing was suggested to be the combustion of crop residuals, while the contribution from softwood burning was also non-negligible, especially in winter. © 2013 Author(s).},

  abstract = {Epidemiologic studies have shown associations between ambient particulate matter (PM) and adverse health outcomes including increased mortality, emergency room visits, and time lost from school and work. The mechanisms of PM-related health effects are still incompletely understood, but a hypothesis under investigation is that many of the adverse health effects may derive from oxidative stress, initiated by the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within affected cells. While the adverse effects from PM have historically been associated with the airborne concentration of PM and more recently fine-particle PM, we considered it relevant to develop an assay to quantitatively measure the ability of PM to catalyze ROS generation as the initial step in the induction of oxidative stress. This ability of PM could then be related to different sources, chemical composition, and physical and spatial/temporal characteristics in the ambient environment. The measurement of ROS-forming ability in relation to sources and other factors will have potential relevance to control of redox-active PM. If oxidative stress represents a relevant mechanism of toxicity from PM, the measurement of redox activity represents a first step in the elucidation of the subsequent downstream processes. We have developed an assay for PM redox activity, utilizing the reduction of oxygen by dithiothreitol which serves as an electron source. We have found that PM will catalyze the reduction of oxygen and have examined the distribution and chemical characteristics of the redox activity of PM fractions collected in different sites in the Los Angeles Basin. Samples of concentrated coarse, fine, and ultrafine PM, obtained with aerosol concentrators, were studied with regard to their chemical properties and redox activity. Redox activity was highest in the ultrafine fraction, in agreement with results indicating ultrafines were the most potent toward inducing that heme oxygenase expression and depleting intracellular glutathione, which has relevance to induction of oxidative stress. Comparison of the redox activity with chemical composition showed a reasonable correlation of redox activity with elemental carbon (r2=0.79), organic carbon (r2=0.53), and with benzo[ghi]perylene (r2=0.82), consistent with species typically found in mobile emission sources. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {The use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in natural image classification systems has produced very impressive results. Combined with the inherent nature of medical images that make them ideal for deep-learning, further application of such systems to medical image classification holds much promise. However, the usefulness and potential impact of such a system can be completely negated if it does not reach a target accuracy. In this paper, we present a study on determining the optimum size of the training data set necessary to achieve high classification accuracy with low variance in medical image classification systems. The CNN was applied to classify axial Computed Tomography (CT) images into six anatomical classes. We trained the CNN using six different sizes of training data set (5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200) and then tested the resulting system with a total of 6000 CT images. All images were acquired from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). Using this data, we employ the learning curve approach to predict classification accuracy at a given training sample size. Our research will present a general methodology for determining the training data set size necessary to achieve a certain target classification accuracy that can be easily applied to other problems within such systems.}

Long-term monitoring data of PM2.5 chemical composition and source-specific tracers provide essential information for the identification of major sources as well as evaluation and planning of control measures. In this study, we present and analyze a 10-year dataset of PM2.5 major components and source-specific tracers (e.g., levoglucosan, hopanes, K+, Ni, V, Al, and Si) collected over the period of 2008-2017 in an urban site in Hong Kong, China. The time series of pollutants were analyzed by the seasonal and trend decomposition using the locally estimated scatter plot smoothing (LOESS) method and general least squares with the autoregressive moving average method. Bulk PM2.5 and all its major components displayed a significant decline of varying degrees over the decade. PM2.5 was reduced by 40 \% at -1.5 μgm-3yr-1. PM2.5 components that are predominantly influenced by local vehicular emissions showed the steepest decline, with nitrate decreasing by -66 \%, elemental carbon by -60 \%, and hopanes by -75 \%, confirming effective control of local vehicular emissions. For components that are significantly impacted by regional transport and secondary formation, they had a notably lower percentage reduction, with sulfate declining by -40 \% and organic carbon by -23 \%, reflecting complexity in their region-wide contributing sources and formation chemistry. Levoglucosan and K+, two tracers for biomass burning, differed in their reduction extent, with K+ at -60 \% and levoglucosan at -47 \%, indicating they likely track different biomass burning types. Dust components in PM2.5 also decreased, by -37 \% for Al and -46 \% for Si. The year of 2011 was an anomaly in the overall trend in having higher concentrations of PM2.5 and components than its adjacent years, and the long time series analysis attributed the anomaly to unusually lower rainfall associated with strong La Niña events. This 10-year trend analysis based on measurements exemplifies the utility of chemical composition data in support of an evidence-based approach for control policy formulation.}

The samples were analyzed for elemental concentrations by instrumental neutron activation analysis. The data sets were then analyzed by positive matrix factorization followed by rotation to identify the possible sources of atmospheric aerosols in both areas. The best solutions were found to be six factors for elemental compositions of each of the "ne and coarse particulate matter fractions at the urban site and "ve factors each for both "ne and coarse fractions at the suburban location. Soil was the major source of airborne particulate matter identi"ed for all data sets. The motor vehicle factor showed much higher concentration for Br in urban than in suburban area. A motorcycle factor with high concentrations of Zn and Mn were found at the urban site. The factor containing highest concentrations of Na and Cl was attributed to sea-salt and was clearly seen in the urban atmosphere. The site was located 35 km to the north from the Gulf of Thailand and was in\#uenced by wind from the south and southwest for most of the year. Charcoal/wood burning and incineration factors were likely to be the local sources. A factor with high concentration of Ca was attributed to a construction near the urban residential site and from two plaster manufacturing factories close to the suburban residential site.

At Dye 3, continuously sampled aerosols (54 filters) show a clear seasonal cycle of insoluble mineral elements (Al, Fe, Ca) with strong concentration peaks in April. The simultaneous collection of fresh snows (32 precipitation events) reveals the same seasonal picture. Furthermore, a comparison of metal concentrations in both aerosol and snow indicates that the transfer of crustal elements (Fe or Al) from air to snow seems to occur without fractionation. This one year seasonal cycle is recovered in snowpits excavated at Dye 3 (1 yr) and at Summit (3 yr) exhibiting no major post-depositional changes of crustal elements in aging snow. This suggests that the insoluble fraction of crustal elements, such as Fe or Al, in Arctic snows accurately reflects the seasonal atmospheric signal of mineral aerosols.}

Different a-cellular assay are currently used in the literature for the determination of the PM oxidative potential (OP), which is considered as a predictive index of its capacity to generate ROS in biological organisms. In order to better understand the existing correlations between PO and PM generated by specific emission sources, the water soluble and insoluble fractions of seven dust coming from specific sources were chemically characterised and analysed by three PO assays: the dithiothreitol (DTT, the acid ascorbic (AA) and the 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin (DCFH) assays. PO and chemical data were elaborated by principal constituent analysis. The three methods responded in a very different way to each dust; they are then no-interchangeable and probably none of them is able to correctly predict the ROS generation in biological organisms. DTT was particularly sensitive to organic compounds, while AA was mostly influenced by inorganic components. DCFH results are more difficult to interpret and need to be further deepened. Furthermore, the results confirmed the important role played by the insoluble components of dusts in generating oxidative processes.},

  abstract = {Secondary organic aerosol (SOA), a prominent fraction of particulate organic mass (OA), remains poorly constrained. Its formation involves several unknown precursors, formation and evolution pathways and multiple natural and anthropogenic sources. Here a combined gas-particle phase source apportionment is applied to wintertime and summertime data collected in the megacity of Paris in order to investigate SOA origin during both seasons. This was possible by combining the information provided by an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) and a proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS). A better constrained apportionment of primary OA (POA) sources is also achieved using this methodology, making use of gas-phase tracers. These tracers made possible the discrimination between biogenic and continental/anthropogenic sources of SOA. We found that continental SOA was dominant during both seasons (24–50 \% of total OA), while contributions from photochemistrydriven SOA (9 \% of total OA) and marine emissions (13 \% of total OA) were also observed during summertime. A semivolatile nighttime component was also identified (up to 18 \% of total OA during wintertime). This approach was successfully applied here and implemented in a new source apportionment toolkit.},

  abstract = {Particulate air pollution being recognized to be responsible for short and long term health effects, regulations for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 (PM2.5) are more and more restrictive. PM2.5 regulation is based on mass without taking into account PM2.5 composition that drives toxicity. Measurement of the oxidative potential (OP) of PM could be an additional PM indicator that would encompass the PM components involved in oxidative stress, the main mechanism of PM toxicity. We compared different methods to evaluate the intrinsic oxidative potential of PM2.5 sampled in Paris and their ability to reflect the oxidative and inflammatory response in bronchial epithelial cells used as relevant target organ cells. The dithiothreitol depletion assay, the antioxidant (ascorbic acid and glutathione) depletion assay (OPAO), the plasmid scission assay and the dichlorofluorescein (DCFH) oxidation assay used to characterize the OP of PM2.5 (10–100 μg/mL) provided positive results of different magnitude with all the PM2.5 samples used with significant correlation with different metals such as Cu and Zn as well as total polyaromatic hydrocarbons and the soluble organic fraction. The OPAO assay showed the best correlation with the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species by NCI-H292 cell line assessed by DCFH oxidation and with the expression of anti-oxidant genes (superoxide dismutase 2, heme-oxygenase-1) as well as the proinflammatory response (Interleukin 6) when exposed from 1 to 10 μg/cm2. The OPAO assay appears as the most prone to predict the biological effect driven by PM2.5 and related to oxidative stress.},

  abstract = {Background: Few cohort studies have evaluated the risk of mortality associated with long-term exposure to fine particulate matter [≤ 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5)]. This is the first national-level cohort study to investigate these risks in Canada. Objective: We investigated the association between long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 and cardiovascular mortality in nonimmigrant Canadian adults. Methods: We assigned estimates of exposure to ambient PM2.5 derived from satellite observations to a cohort of 2.1 million Canadian adults who in 1991 were among the 20\% of the population mandated to provide detailed census data. We identified deaths occurring between 1991 and 2001 through record linkage. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for available individual-level and contextual covariates using both standard Cox proportional survival models and nested, spatial random-effects survival models. Results: Using standard Cox models, we calculated HRs of 1.15 (95\% CI: 1.13, 1.16) from nonaccidental causes and 1.31 (95\% CI: 1.27, 1.35) from ischemic heart disease for each 10-μg/m3 increase in concentrations of PM2.5. Using spatial random-effects models controlling for the same variables, we calculated HRs of 1.10 (95\% CI: 1.05, 1.15) and 1.30 (95\% CI: 1.18, 1.43), respectively. We found similar associations between nonaccidental mortality and PM2.5 based on satellite-derived estimates and ground-based measurements in a sub-analysis of subjects in 11 cities. Conclusions: In this large national cohort of nonimmigrant Canadians, mortality was associated with long-term exposure to PM2.5. Associations were observed with exposures to PM2.5 at concentrations that were predominantly lower (mean, 8.7 μg/m3; interquartile range, 6.2 μg/m3) than those reported previously.},

Objective: We investigated associations between cause-specific mortality and ambient concentrations of fine particulate matter (≤ 2.5 μm; PM2.5), ozone (O3), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in a national cohort of about 2.5 million Canadians. Methods: We assigned estimates of annual concentrations of these pollutants to the residential postal codes of subjects for each year during 16 years of follow-up. Historical tax data allowed us to track subjects’ residential postal code annually. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for each pollutant separately and adjusted for the other pollutants. We also estimated the product of the three HRs as a measure of the cumulative association with mortality for several causes of death for an increment of the mean minus the 5th percentile of each pollutant: 5.0 μg/m3 for PM2.5, 9.5 ppb for O3, and 8.1 ppb for NO2. Results: PM2.5, O3, and NO2 were associated with nonaccidental and cause-specific mortality in single-pollutant models. Exposure to PM2.5 alone was not sufficient to fully characterize the toxicity of the atmospheric mix or to fully explain the risk of mortality associated with exposure to ambient pollution. Assuming additive associations, the estimated HR for nonaccidental mortality corresponding to a change in exposure from the mean to the 5th percentile for all three pollutants together was 1.075 (95\% CI: 1.067, 1.084). Accounting for residential mobility had only a limited impact on the association between mortality and PM2.5 and O3, but increased associa-tions with NO2. conclusions: In this large, national-level cohort, we found positive associations between several common causes of death and exposure to PM2.5, O3, and NO2.}

The average concentrations of 14 individual TEs ranged from 1.1 (V) to 900 ng/m3 (K). The occurrence levels of most TEs of interest in Beijing were lower than those in most domestic cities, but higher than those in most foreign countries. The formation of sulfate increased with the concentrations of all studied TEs during autumn and winter. Dust, industry, biomass burning and waste incineration, vehicle emissions, coal combustion, and oil combustion were identified by the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model, which accounted for 36.3\%, 10.7\%, 27.1\%, 13.7\%, 7.6\%, and 4.6\%, respectively, of the total elements. All factors exhibited higher concentrations on weekends than on weekdays. Local vehicular emissions and industry contributed to the loading of TEs, but dust, biomass burning and waste incineration, coal combustion, and oil combustion from neighboring areas appeared to be dominant sources of TEs. Except for dust and industry, the four other sources of TEs were mainly located in the south and southeast areas of the sampling site. The analysis by conditional probability function and potential source contribution function showed that the distribution of the PMF sources of TEs roughly agreed with the location of the main point sources.

  abstract = {Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a major contributor to the degree of air pollution, and it is associated with a range of adverse health impacts. Moreover, the oxidative potential (OP, as a tracer of oxidative stress) of PM2.5 has been thought to be a possible determinant of its health impact. In this study, the OP of 136 fine aerosol filter samples collected in Changzhou in two seasons (spring and summer) were determined using a dithiothreitol (DTT) assay. Source apportionments of the PM2.5 and DTT activity were further performed. Our results showed that the daily average ± standard deviation of the DTTv (volume-normalized DTT activity) in the PM2.5 was 1.16 ± 0.58 nmol/min/m3 and 0.85 ± 0.16 nmol/min/m3 in the spring and summer, respectively, and the DTTm (mass-normalized DTT activity) was 13.56 ± 5.45 pmol/min/µg and 19.97 ± 6.54 pmol/min/µg in the spring and summer, respectively. The DTTv was higher in the spring compared to the summer while the opposite was true for the DTTm. Most of the detected components (including the organic component, element component, NH4+, Mn, Cu, Zn, etc.) exhibited a moderately positive correlation with the DTTv, but the opposite was found with the DTTm. An aerodyne high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometer (HP-AMS) was deployed to probe the chemical properties of the water-soluble organic matter (WSOA). Positive matrix factorization (PMF) coupled with multiple linear regression was used to obtain the relative source contributions to the DTT activity for the WSOA in the PM2.5. The results showed that the sensitivity sequences of the DTTv to the WSOA sources were oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA) {$>$} biomass burning OA (BBOA) {$>$} hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA) in the spring and HOA {$>$} nitrogen-enriched OA (NOA) {$>$} OOA in the summer. The PMF suggested the highest contribution from traffic emissions to the DTTv of the PM2.5 in both seasons. Our findings point to the importance of both organic components from secondary formation and transition metals to adverse health effects in this region. This study can provide an important reference for adopting appropriate public health policies regarding the detrimental outcomes of exposure to PM2.5.},

Their aqueous extracts were nebulized simultaneously to an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) and a recently developed extractive electrospray ionization (EESI) mass spectrometer, for bulk and near-molecular organic aerosol (OA) composition, respectively. Carbonate was quantified using EESI and a total organic carbon analyzer to separate inorganic carbon from dust. Via isotopically-labelled internal standards and positive matrix factorization, seven water-soluble sources were quantified separately using the AMS- and EESI-based analyses, with consistent types, concentrations, and correlations. These include dust, solid fuel combustion (SFC)-related, nitrogen- (and sulfur-) containing, summer/winter oxygenated OAs, and a cigarette-related OA only in EESI. When accounting for water-solubility, SFC-related OAs were the largest (53\%) sources in Chongqing, while dust (consisting of 77\% OA and 23\% carbonates) was the largest (30\%) source in Xi’an. Overall, this study presents one of the first times that complementary mass spectrometric techniques independently resolved consistent OA sources�with added chemical information�over multiple seasons and locations of complex pollution. The methods and quantified sources are essential for subsequent chemical, modelling, and health studies, and policy making for air pollution mitigation.},

Data on mean annual levels of PM 2.5 measured at Montseny (MSY, North East Spain) and various RB sites in Spain and Europe are evaluated and compared, and subsequently analysed for statistically significant trends. The MSY site registered higher average PM 2.5 levels than those measured at a selection of other RB sites across Spain, Portugal, Germany and Scandinavia by percentage compared to the mean of all the stations in these countries, but lower than those measured in Switzerland, Italy and Austria. Reductions in PM 2.5 were observed across all stations in Spain and Europe to varying degrees (7-49\%). MSY underwent a statistically significant reduction since measurements began, indicating a year-on-year gradual decrease (-3.7 μg m -3, calculated from the final year of data compared to the mean). Similar trends were observed in other RB sites across Spain (-1.9 μg mg-3). Reductions recorded in PM 2.5 across Europe were varied, with many experiencing gradual, year-on-year decreases (-1.8 μg m-3). These reductions have been attributed to various causes: the introduction and implementation of pollution abatement strategies in EU member states, the effect of the current economic crisis on emissions of PM 2.5 and the influence of meteorology observed during the winters of 2009 and 2010. In addition, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), a large scale meteorological phenomenon most prevalent during winter, was observed to influence the frequency of Saharan dust intrusions across the Iberian Peninsula. Chemical composition of PM 2.5 at MSY is characterised by high levels of organic matter (OM) and sulphate, followed by crustal material, nitrate and ammonia. Sea Spray and elemental carbon (EC) comprised a minor part of the total PM 2.5 mass. Statistical trend analysis was performed on the various chemical components of PM 2.5 recorded at MSY to determine which components were accountable for the decrease in PM 2.5 concentration. It is shown that OM underwent the largest decrease over the time period with a statistically significant trend (-1.3 μg m -3 compared to the mean), followed by sulphate (-0.8 μg m-3), ammonium (-0.5 μg m -3) and nitrate (-0.4 μg m -3). Conversely, sea spray, EC and crustal material reductions were found to be negligible. © 2012 Author(s).},

This study presents the molecular composition of organic aerosol (OA) using ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry (Orbitrap) at an urban site in Central Europe (Zurich, Switzerland). Specific source spectra were also analysed, including samples representative of wood-burning emissions from Alpine valleys during wood-burning pollution episodes and smog chamber investigations of woodsmoke, as well as samples from Hyytiälä, which were strongly influenced by biogenic secondary organic aerosol. While samples collected during winter in Alpine valleys have a molecular composition remarkably similar to fresh laboratory wood-burning emissions, winter samples from Zurich are influenced by more aged wood-burning emissions. In addition, other organic aerosol emissions or formation pathways seem to be important at the latter location in winter. Samples from Zurich during summer are similar to those collected in Hyytiälä and are predominantly impacted by oxygenated compounds with an H∕C ratio of 1.5, indicating the importance of biogenic precursors for secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation at this location (summertime Zurich – carbon number 7.6, O:C 0.7; Hyytiälä – carbon number 10.5, O:C 0.57). We could explain the strong seasonality of the molecular composition at a typical European site by primary and aged wood-burning emissions and biogenic secondary organic aerosol formation during winter and summer, respectively. Results presented here likely explain the rather constant seasonal predominance of non-fossil organic carbon at European locations.},

In winter, organic aerosol pollution arises mainly from fresh solid-fuel emissions and secondary organic aerosols originating from both solid-fuel combustion and aqueous processes, probably involving multiphase chemistry with aromatic compounds. The most severe haze is linked to secondary organic aerosols originating from solid-fuel combustion, transported from the Beijing–Tianjing–Hebei Plain and rural mountainous areas west of Beijing. In summer, the increased fraction of secondary organic aerosol is dominated by aromatic emissions from the Xi’an–Shanghai–Beijing region, while the contribution of biogenic emissions remains relatively small. Overall, we identify the main sources of secondary organic aerosol affecting Beijing, which clearly extend beyond the local emissions in Beijing. Our results suggest that targeting key organic precursor emission sectors regionally may be needed to effectively mitigate organic aerosol pollution.},

  abstract = {Rotational ambiguity in factor analyses prevents users from obtaining accurate source apportionment results. The rotational space in positive matrix factorization (PMF) can be reduced by constraining the solution with a prioriinformation such as source profiles. However, the only prior report on constraints using information on the source contributions was their use to ensure compatibility in the simultaneous analyses of PM2.5 and PM10 data. By combining data from three monitoring sites affected by a gear casting plant in Xi'an as an example, a methodology for improving the accuracy of PMF results by constraining source contributions using wind information was explored. Seven common factors derived from individual PMF analyses for each of the three sites (INDUS, URBAN, and RURAL) with different location characteristics, were then combined in a multisite PMF analysis. The factors were interpreted as nitrate with all site average contributions of 28.7\%, sulfate (22.5\%), coal combustion (19.3\%), road traffic (12.8\%), biomass burning (6.4\%), soil (5.4\%), and metallurgical industry (4.9\%). Except for the INDUS site, contributions of metallurgical industry to the URBAN and RURAL sites were pulled down maximally to reduce the rotational space. The constrained solution substantially improved the results over the base run. The local and regional nature of the sources were identified by coefficient of divergence combined with Pearson correlation analysis, and further quantitatively estimated using Lenschow approach. On average, local sources contributed for 52.4\% and 47.7\% of the PM2.5 mass concentrations at the INDUS and URBAN site respectively. The metallurgical industry showed the highest local contributions while sulfate was primarily regional. For the multisite analysis where there are considerable point source emissions, this methodology highlights the role of local wind directions to inform constraints on the results and obtaining more reliable solutions.},

  abstract = {Factor analysis models use the covariance of measured variables to identify and apportion sources. These models, particularly positive matrix factorization (PMF), have been extensively used for analyzing particle number concentrations (PNCs) datasets. However, the variation of observed PNCs and particle size distribution are driven by both the source emission rates and atmospheric dispersion as well as chemical and physical transformation processes. This variation in the observation data caused by meteorologically induced dilution reduces the ability to obtain accurate source apportionment results. To reduce the influence of dilution on quantitative source estimates, a methodology for improving the accuracy of source apportionment results by incorporating a measure of dispersion, the ventilation coefficient, into the PMF analysis (called dispersion normalized PMF, DN-PMF) was applied to a PNC dataset measured from a field campaign that includes the Spring Festival event and the start of the COVID-19 lockdown in Tianjin, China. The data also included gaseous pollutants and hourly PM2.5 compositional data. Eight factors were resolved and interpreted as municipal incinerator, traffic nucleation, secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA), traffic emissions, photonucleation, coal combustion, residential heating and festival emissions. The DN-PMF enhanced the diel patterns of photonucleation and the two traffic factors by enlarging the differences between daytime peak values and nighttime concentrations. The municipal incinerator plant, traffic emissions, and coal combustion have cleaner and more clearly defined directionalities after dispersion normalization. Thus, dispersion normalized PMF is capable of enhancing the source emission patterns. After the COVID-19 lockdown began, PNC of traffic nucleation and traffic emissions decreased by 41\% and 44\%, respectively, while photonucleation produced more particles likely due to the reduction in the condensation sink. The significant changes in source emissions indicate a substantially reduced traffic volume after the implement of lockdown measures.},

  abstract = {Derivatives of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as nitrated- and oxygenated-PAHs (NPAHs and OPAHs) could be even more toxic and harmful for the environment and humans than PAHs. We assessed the spatial and seasonal variations of NPAHs and OPAHs atmospheric levels, their cancer risks and their gas-to-particle partitioning. To this end, about 250 samples of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and 50 gaseous samples were collected in 2017 in central Europe in the cities of Brno and Ljubljana (two traffic and two urban background sites) as well as one rural site. The average particulate concentrations were ranging from below limit of quantification to 593 pg m−3 for Σ9NPAHs and from 1.64 to 4330 pg m−3 for Σ11OPAHs, with significantly higher concentrations in winter compared to summer. In winter, the particulate levels of NPAHs and OPAHs were higher at the traffic site compared to the urban background site in Brno while the opposite was found in Ljubljana. NPAHs and OPAHs particulate levels were influenced by the meteorological parameters and co-varied with several air pollutants. The significance of secondary formation on the occurrence of some NPAHs and OPAHs is indicated. In winter, 27–47\% of samples collected at all sites were above the acceptable lifetime carcinogenic risk. The gas-particle partitioning of NPAHs and OPAHs was influenced by their physico-chemical properties, the season and the site-specific aerosol composition. Three NPAHs and five OPAHs had higher particulate mass fractions at the traffic site, suggesting they could be primarily emitted as particles from vehicle traffic and subsequently partitioning to the gas phase along air transport. This study underlines the importance of inclusion of the gas phase in addition to the particulate phase when assessing the atmospheric fate of polycyclic aromatic compounds and also when assessing the related health risk.},

Objective: To assess the association of pre- and post-natal exposure to air pollution with life-time prevalence of AR in preschool children. Methods: We conducted a cohort study of 2598 children aged 3e6 years in Changsha, China. The lifetime prevalence of AR was assessed by a questionnaire administered by parents. Children's exposures to dioxide nitrogen (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter  10 mm (PM10) during different pre- and post-natal timing windows were estimated using the measured concentrations at monitoring stations. The odds ratio (OR) and 95\% confidence interval (CI) of childhood AR for exposure to different air pollutants during different timing windows were assessed by logistic regression model in terms of an interquartile range (IQR) increase in exposure level. Results: Life-time prevalence of AR in preschool children (7.3\%) was associated with both pre- and postnatal exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP), but only significant during the third trimester of pregnancy with adjusted OR ¼ 1.40 (95\% CI: 1.08e1.82) for a 15 mg/m3 increase in NO2 and during the first-year of life with adjusted OR ¼ 1.36 (95\% CI: 1.03e1.78) and 1.54 (95\% CI: 1.07e2.21) respectively for 11 and 12 mg/m3 increase in NO2 and PM10. The association of early life exposure to TRAP with childhood AR was robust by adjusting for other air pollutants and timing windows. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the association was higher in the children who are male, young, with genetic predisposition by parental atopy, and living in damp houses. Conclusion: Early life exposure to traffic-related air pollutant during pregnancy and first-year of life may contribute to childhood AR.},

The objective of this work is to predict the deposition of particles from different sources in the human lung. The whole lung, consisting of 24 generations of branches from trachea to alveoli, was approximated using a one-dimensional lumped “trumpet” model with a variable cross-sectional area. The aerosol dynamics equation was numerically solved using a finite difference method to investigate the transport and deposition of particles in the lung model. Particles from various sources were assumed to be different in both size and density. We found that in general, coarse particles ({$>$} 2.5 µm) were mainly deposited in the tracheobronchial (TB) region by impaction, and fine particles ({$<$} 2.5 µm) were mainly deposited in the pulmonary (P) region by sedimentation and diffusion. However, the coarse particles with low density can be deposited in P region by sedimentation. As a comparison, our results found that soil particles, which are coarse with low density, were deposited in the deep lung more than traffic particles, which are fine with high density. Modeling of particle deposition in the human lung indicated that coarse particles generated by crustal sources may have adverse health effects as strong as those resulting from fine particles generated from combustion sources.},

To comprehensively assess the changes in ambient PM2.5 concentrations and the corresponding health risk with the implementation of APPCAP, this study examined PM2.5 samples collected in Wuhan in 2012/2013 and 2018 for water-soluble ions, carbonaceous fractions, and elements, respectively. Dithiothreitol (DTT) assay was used to determine the oxidation potential (OP) of PM2.5. The positive matrix factorization (PMF) model and the multiple linear regression (MLR) model were used to analyze PM2.5 sources and the contribution of each source to the OP of PM2.5. The results showed that PM2.5 concentrations in Wuhan decreased significantly, however, there was little change in the health risk and a significant increase in intrinsic toxicity. DTTv (the volume-normalized dithiothreitol) showed high correlations (r {$>$} 0.5, p {$<$} 0.01) with water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), organic carbon (OC), secondary ions (NO3−, SO42−, and NH4+), and elements. Compared to 2012/2013, the contribution of vehicle emissions and secondary aerosol sources to PM2.5 increased significantly in 2018. Biomass burning sources significantly contribute to DTTv in the summer and autumn, and secondary aerosol sources significantly contribute to DTTv in winter. The human health impacts from coal combustion sources remained high, while vehicle emission sources increased. In the context of decreasing PM2.5 concentrations, the role of vehicle emissions health impacts is increasingly significant due to the large increment in vehicle ownership and high inherent OP. Therefore, targeting vehicle emissions for control is of great importance for human health and needs to be given great attention in future policymaking.},

  abstract = {Metropolitan Urban areas in Greece have been known to suffer from poor air quality, due to variety of emission sources, topography and climatic conditions favouring the accumulation of pollution. While a number of control measures have been implemented since the 1990s, resulting in reductions of atmospheric pollution and changes in emission source contributions, the financial crisis which started in 2009 has significantly altered this picture. The present study is the first effort to assess the contribution of emission sources to PM10 and PM2.5 concentration levels and their long-term variability (over 5–10 years), in the two largest metropolitan urban areas in Greece (Athens and Thessaloniki). Intensive measurement campaigns were conducted during 2011–2012 at suburban, urban background and urban traffic sites in these two cities. In addition, available datasets from previous measurements in Athens and Thessaloniki were used in order to assess the long-term variability of concentrations and sources. Chemical composition analysis of the 2011–2012 samples showed that carbonaceous matter was the most abundant component for both PM size fractions. Significant increase of carbonaceous particle concentrations and of OC/EC ratio during the cold period, especially in the residential urban background sites, pointed towards domestic heating and more particularly wood (biomass) burning as a significant source. PMF analysis further supported this finding. Biomass burning was the largest contributing source at the two urban background sites (with mean contributions for the two size fractions in the range of 24–46\%). Secondary aerosol formation (sulphate, nitrate \& organics) was also a major contributing source for both size fractions at the suburban and urban background sites. At the urban traffic site, vehicular traffic (exhaust and non-exhaust emissions) was the source with the highest contributions, accounting for 44\% of PM10 and 37\% of PM2.5, respectively. The long-term variability of emission sources in the two cities (over 5–10 years), assessed through a harmonized application of the PMF technique on recent and past year data, clearly demonstrates the effective reduction in emissions during the last decade due to control measures and technological development; however, it also reflects the effects of the financial crisis in Greece during these years, which has led to decreased economic activities and the adoption of more polluting practices by the local population in an effort to reduce living costs.},

Exogenous ROS from PM can be assessed by acellular oxidative potential (OP) measurements as a proxy of the induction of oxidative stress in the lungs. Here, we investigate the importance of OP apportionment methods on OP repartition by PM sources in different types of environments. PM sources derived from receptor models (e.g. EPA PMF) are coupled with regression models expressing the associations between PM sources and OP measured by ascorbic acid (OPAA) and 20 dithiothreitol assay (OPDTT). These relationships are compared for eight regression techniques: Ordinary Least Squares, Weighted Least Squares, Positive Least Squares, Ridge, Lasso, Generalized Linear Model, Random Forest, and Multilayer Perceptron. The models are evaluated on one year of PM10 samples and chemical analyses at each of six sites of different typologies in France to assess the possible impact of PM source variability on OP apportionment. Source-specific OPDTT and OPAA and out-of-sample apportionment accuracy vary substantially by 25 model, highlighting the importance of model selection depending on the datasets. Recommendations for the selection of the most accurate model are provided, encompassing considerations such as multicollinearity and homoscedasticity.},

  abstract = {The oxidative potential (OP) of particulate matter (PM) has recently been considered as a viable health-based metric of PM exposure. Several acellular assays have been developed to assess OP, but there is no clear consensus in the methodology or protocols used that allows inter-comparison between studies. This research investigates five different acellular OP assays and their sensitivities with the chemical composition of atmospheric particulate matter (PM10) and its emission sources. We revisited and evaluated PM10 samples collected over one year in the urban Alpine city of Grenoble, France. The OP of PM10 was assessed by integrating assays commonly found in the literature, such as ascorbic acid (AA), dithiothreitol (DTT) and 2,7-dichlorofluorescein (DCFH) but also adding novel and less explored assays such as Ferric-Xylenol Orange (FOX), and a direct ROS-quantification through ˙OH. Detailed source apportionment of PM using positive matrix factorisation (PMF) previously performed was coupled with multiple linear regression (MLR) models to determine the OP contribution of PM10 sources. The results highlight the importance of seasonality in the mass contributions of each source and its corresponding influence on OP. These seasonal differences helped to identify the specific reactivity for each studied OP assay. In winter, a good agreement was found between all the OP assays with anthropogenic sources. However, during warmer months, with a reduction in the share of anthropogenic emissions, a higher impact from biogenic and secondary organic-related aerosols has been found. Our results also show a dissimilar sensitivity of each OP to the PM10 sources, likely associated with the chemical composition and chemical processes involved. Thus, our findings show the importance of combining various OP assays to capture different sensitivities to redox-active species to get a clearer picture of the intrinsic capacity of PM sources to cause damaging oxidative reactions in the lung. Providing the heterogeneity of sources obtained with the different OP assays for a given ambient PM exposure, the choice of a single or a combination of OP method(s) must be rationally evaluated as part of the assessment strategy. Such a choice would offer valuable source-related information as a powerful tool to better understand the nature and the intensity of air pollution and envisage the targeted sources for future mitigation policies.},

The PM2.5 concentrations ranged from 8.3 to 148 μg m−3, with an annual average of 40.2 ± 26.3 μg m−3 (from September 2019 to December 2020). Our results obtained by applying the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) source-receptor apportionment model showed the contribution of nine PM2.5 sources. The main anthropogenic sources contributing to the PM mass concentrations were heavy fuel oil (HFO) combustion (25.3 \%), biomass burning (20 \%), primary traffic (7.6 \%) and long-range transport aerosols (10.6 \%). The OP activities were evaluated for the first time in an urban site in Vietnam. The average OPv levels obtained in our study were 3.9 ± 2.4 and 4.5 ± 3.2 nmol min−1 m−3 for OPDTT and OPAA, respectively. We assessed the contribution to OPDTT and OPAA of each PM2.5 source by applying multilinear regression models. It shows that the sources associated with human activities (HFO combustion, biomass burning and primary traffic) are the sources driving OP exposure, suggesting that they should be the first sources to be controlled in future mitigation strategies. This study gives for the first time an extensive and long-term chemical characterization of PM2.5, providing also a link between emission sources, ambient concentrations and exposure to air pollution at an urban site in Hanoi, Vietnam.},

  abstract = {Following population growth and rapid urbanization, West African cities have become major sources of anthropogenic pollution. Additionally, Saharan dust has had a significant impact, representing a potentially toxic mix of sources for the population. This study characterizes the atmospheric composition and its sources in two African capitals, Bamako, Mali and Dakar, Senegal. TSP, PM10 and PM2.5 samples were collected during the dry season in 2009 when pollution levels were high: chemical analysis included organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), ions, and metals. PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were 5–10 times and 3–8 times higher, respectively, than the 2005 WHO 24 h standards. Using PCA and PMF methodologies, five sources were identified in each city. In Bamako, traffic (motor vehicles and resuspended road dust) was the prevailing source of PM2.5 and PM10, accounting for 47\% and 45\%, respectively. Crustal dust was the second most important source (24–30\%), followed by solid fuel combustion (16–13\%) and secondary aerosols (10–16\%). In Dakar, the following sources of PM2.5 and PM10 are identified: traffic (49\%), mineral dust (16–25\%), sea salts (15–20\%) and industries (10–11\%). Our study provides crucial information about the historical change in source characteristics in these two African cities, which can help for future mitigation strategies.},

PM2.5 variation was influenced by CO (17\%), SO2 (19\%), NH3 (12\%), O3 (10\%), air pressure (P, 9.9\%), and temperature (T, 10\%) during the whole period. SOR was determined by SO2 (15\%), temperature (T, 9.8\%), relative humidity (RHU, 15\%), and pondus hydrogenii (pH, 35\%), and NOR was influenced by NOx (19\%), O3 (14\%), NH3 (13\%), and RHU (15\%). Three types of pollution episodes were captured. Process I was characterized by high CO (contributing 40\% of PM2.5 concentration variation estimated by the random forest) due to coal combustion for heating during winter in northern China. According to the PMF, coal combustion (32\%) and secondary sources (38\%) were both the most important contributors in the first stage, and then, when the RHU increased to above 80\%, the highest contribution was from secondary sources (40\%). Process II was during the Spring Festival and was characterized by 8.8 μg m−3 firework contribution. High SO2 during this process, especially on the CNY’s Eve, was observed due to the firework displays, and SO2 gave a high contribution (24\%) to PM2.5 variation. Process III showed high ions and high RHU in summer with sulfate and nitrate contributing 44\% and 22\%, respectively. Furthermore, meteorological parameters and NH3 play a key role on SOR and NOR.},

The presence of excess reactive oxygen species can lead to cellular damage of deoxyribonucleic acids, lipids and proteins. Antioxidants protect cells from peroxidation reactions, limiting cellular damage and helping to maintain cellular membrane integrity. There is overwhelming evidence for oxidative stress causing harm in reproduction. However, there is sparse evidence that supplementation with commonly used antioxidants (mostly vitamins C and E) makes any difference in overcoming oxidative stress or reversing disease processes. There may be potential for antioxidant therapy to ameliorate or prevent disease, but this requires a thorough understanding of the mechanism of action and specificity of currently used antioxidants.},

To address this issue, an isoprene/NOX/air mixture was irradiated in a flow reactor smog chamber in both the absence and presence of SO2 to measure the SOA yield of isoprene and to establish whether the two 2-methyl tetrols and 2-methylglyceric acid are present in isoprene SOA and could serve as SOA indicator compounds. In the absence of SO2, the SOA yield of 0.002 was low, as expected, although uncertain because the SOA concentration was near chamber background levels. However, in the presence of SO2, the SOA yield increased significantly to 0.028. Analysis of the trimethylsilyl derivatives of the SOA samples by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry showed chamber concentrations of the two 2-methyl tetrols totaling 0.1μgm−3 and a 2-methylglyceric acid concentration of 0.4μgm−3 in the absence of SO2, with the levels increasing significantly to 6.3μgm−3 and 1.2μgm−3, respectively, when SO2 was added. The laboratory data suggest that these compounds are possible indicator compounds for isoprene SOA and that the presence of SO2 enhances significantly SOA formation from isoprene photooxidation, with acid-catalyzed reactions possibly playing a major role. The importance of these findings was supported by the detection of the two 2-methyl tetrols and 2-methylglyceric acid in summertime ambient PM2.5 samples collected at three locations in the eastern United States. However, additional mechanistic studies are required to predict the contributions of the SO2-assisted isoprene SOA formation to ambient PM2.5 concentrations.},

  abstract = {Little attention is given to applying the artificial neural network (ANN) modeling technique to understand site– specific air pollution dispersion mechanisms, the order of importance of meteorological variables in determining concentrations as well as the important time scales that influence emission patterns. In this paper, we propose a methodology for extracting the key information from routinely–available meteorological parameters and the emission pattern of sources present throughout the year (e.g. traffic emissions) to build a reliable and physically– based ANN air pollution forecasting tool. The methodology is tested by modeling NO2 concentrations at a site near a major highway in Auckland, New Zealand. The basic model consists of an ANN model for predicting NO2 concen- trations using eight predictor variables: wind speed, wind direction, solar radiation, temperature, relative humidity, as well as “hour of the day”, “day of the week” and “month of the year” representing the time variations in emissions according to their corresponding time scales. Of the three input optimization techniques explored in this study, namely a genetic algorithm, forward selection, and backward elimination, the genetic algorithm technique gave predictions resulting in the smallest mean absolute error. The nature of the internal nonlinear function of the trained genetically–optimized neural network model was then extracted based on the response of the model to perturbations to individual predictor variables through sensitivity analyses. A simplified model, based on the successive removal of the least significant meteorological predictor variables, was then developed until subsequent removal resulted in a significant decrease in model performance. The developed ANN model was found to outperform a linear regression model based on the same input parameters. The proposed approach illustrates how the ANN modeling technique can be used to identify the key meteorological variables required to adequately capture the temporal variability in air pollution concentrations for a specific scenario.},

  abstract = {Background: The purpose of this research was to determine the relationship between modeled particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure and birth weight, including the potential modification by maternal risk factors and indicators of socioeconomic status (SES). Methods: Birth records from 2001 to 2006 (N = 231,929) were linked to modeled PM2.5 data from a national land-use regression model along with neighbourhood-level SES and socio-demographic data using 6-digit residential postal codes. Multilevel random coefficient models were used to estimate the effects of PM2.5, SES and other individual and neighbourhood-level covariates on continuous birth weight and test interactions. Gestational age was modeled with a random slope to assess potential neighbourhood-level differences of its effect on birth weight and whether any between-neighbourhood variability can be explained by cross-level interactions. Results: Models adjusted for individual and neighbourhood-level covariates showed a significant non-linear negative association between PM2.5 and birth weight explaining 8.5 \% of the between-neighbourhood differences in mean birth weight. A significant interaction between SES and PM2.5 was observed, revealing a more pronounced negative effect of PM2.5 on birth weight in lower SES neighbourhoods. Further positive and negative modification of the PM2.5 effect was observed with maternal smoking, maternal age, gestational diabetes, and suspected maternal drug or alcohol use. The random intercept variance indicating between-neighbourhood birth weight differences was reduced by 75 \% in the final model, while the random slope variance for between-neighbourhood gestational age effects remained virtually unchanged. Conclusion: We provide evidence that neighbourhood-level SES variables and PM2.5 have both independent and interacting associations with birth weight, and together account for 49 \% of the between-neighbourhood differences in birth weight. Evidence of effect modification of PM2.5 on birth weight across various maternal and neighbourhood-level factors suggests that certain sub-populations may be more or less vulnerable to relatively low doses PM2.5 exposure.},

  abstract = {Conventional environmental health research is primarily focused on isolated chemical exposures, neglecting the complex interactions between multiple pollutants that may synergistically or antagonistically influence toxicity, thereby posing unexpected health risks. In this study, we address this knowledge gap by introducing an explainable machine learning (ML) approach with Feature Localized Intercept Transformed-Shapley Additive Explanations (FLIT-SHAP) designed to extract the dose-response relationships of specific pollutants in mixtures. In contrast to traditional SHAP, FLIT-SHAP can localize the global intercept to elucidate mixture effects, which is crucial for understanding the oxidative potential (OP) of ambient particulate matter (PM). Assessing multi-pollutant OP using FLIT-SHAP revealed both synergistic (55–63\%) and antagonistic (25–42\%) effects in laboratory-controlled OP data, but an antagonistic (33–66\%; lower OP) effect in ambient PM. Notably, the FLIT-SHAP approach demonstrated higher prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.99) compared to the additive model (R2 = 0.89) when evaluated against real-world PM samples. Quinones, such as phenanthrenequinone, play a more significant role in PM2.5 than previously recognized. Through this study, we highlighted the potential of FLIT-SHAP to enhance toxicity predictions and aid decision-making in the field of environmental health.},

  abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the oxidative potential (OP) of PM2.5 collected for almost a year in an urban area of the East Mediterranean. Two acellular assays, based on ascorbic acid (AA) and dithiothreitol (DTT) depletion, were used to measure the OP. The results showed that the mean volume normalized OP-AAv value was 0.64 ± 0.29 nmol·min−1·m−3 and the mean OP-DTTv was 0.49 ± 0.26 nmol·min−1·m−3. Several approaches were adopted in this work to study the relationship between the species in PM2.5 (carbonaceous matter, water-soluble ions, major and trace elements, and organic compounds) or their sources and OP values. Spearman correlations revealed strong correlations of OP-AAv with carbonaceous subfractions as well as organic compounds while OP-DTTv seemed to be more correlated with elements emitted from different anthropogenic activities. Furthermore, a multiple linear regression method was used to estimate the contribution of PM2.5 sources, determined by a source-receptor model (Positive Matrix Factorization), to the OP values. The results showed that the sources that highly contribute to the PM2.5 mass (crustal dust and ammonium sulfate) were not the major sources contributing to the values of OP. Instead, 69 \% of OP-AAv and 62 \% of OP-DTTv values were explained by three local anthropogenic sources: Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) combustion from a power plant, biomass burning, and road traffic emissions. As for the seasonal variations, higher OP-AAv values were observed during winter compared to summer, while OP-DTTv did not show any significant differences between the two seasons. The contribution of biomass burning during winter was 33 and 34 times higher compared to summer for OP-AAv and OP-DTTv, respectively. On the other hand, higher contributions were observed for HFO combustion during summer.},

The relative impact of these sources remains similar over the whole Alpine massif although transport from US and emissions from Spain contribute less as we move eastward from CDD, toward other alpine ice core drill sites like Colle Gnifetti (CG) in the Swiss Alps. For sulfate, the CDD ice core records and the simulated trends match very well. For ammonium, the trend simulated by the model and the summer ice core record are in reasonable agreement, both showing greater changes in ammonium concentrations than would be suggested by historical ammonia emissions. Motivated by a such good agreement between simulations of past atmospheric concentrations and ice core records for inorganic aerosol species, we also use the model to simulate trends in elemental carbon for which less information on past emission inventories are available.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Water-soluble redox-active metals are potentially toxic due to its ability to catalytically generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vivo, leading to oxidative stress. As part of the Southeastern Center for Air Pollution and Epidemiology (SCAPE), we developed a method to quantify water-soluble elements, including redox-active metals, from a large number of filter samples (N = 530) in support of the center's health studies. PM2.5 samples were collected during 2012–2013 at various sites (three urban, two rural, a near-road site, and a road-side site) in the southeastern United States, using high-volume samplers. Water-soluble elements (S, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Br, Sr, Ba, and Pb) were determined by extracting filters in deionized water and re-aerosolized for analyses by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) using an online aerosol element analyzer (Xact, Cooper Environmental). Concentrations ranged from detection limits (nominally 0.1 to 30 ng m−3) to 1.2 μg m−3, with S as the most abundant element, followed by Ca, K, Fe, Cu, Zn, and Ba. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) identified four factors that were associated with specific sources based on relative loadings of various tracers. These include brake/tire wear (with tracers Ba and Cu), biomass burning (K), secondary formation (S, Se, and WSOC), and mineral dust (Ca). Of the four potentially toxic and relatively abundant metals (redox-active Cu, Mn, Fe, and redox-inactive Zn), 51 \% of Cu, 32 \% of Fe, 17 \% of Mn, and 45 \% of Zn were associated with the brake/tire factor. Mn was mostly associated with the mineral dust factor (45 \%). Zn was found in a mixture of factors, with 26 \% associated with mineral dust, 14 \% biomass burning, and 13 \% secondary formation. Roughly 50 \% of Fe and 40 \% of Cu were apportioned to the secondary formation factor, likely through increases in the soluble fraction of these elements by sulfur-driven aerosol water and acidity. Linkages between sulfate and water-soluble Fe and Cu may account for some of the past observed associations between sulfate/sulfur oxide and health outcomes. For Cu, Mn, Fe, and Zn, only Fe was correlated with PM2.5 mass (r = 0.73–0.80). Overall, mobile source emissions generated through mechanical processes (re-entrained road dust, tire and break wear) and processing by secondary sulfate were major contributors to water-soluble metals known to be capable of generating ROS.},

  abstract = {The ability of certain components of particulate matter to induce oxidative stress through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vivo may be one mechanism accounting for observed linkages between ambient aerosols and adverse health outcomes. A variety of assays have been used to measure this so-called aerosol oxidative potential. We developed a semi-automated system to quantify oxidative potential of filter aqueous extracts utilizing the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay and report here the development of a similar semi-automated system for the ascorbic acid (AA) assay. Approximately 500 PM2.5 filter samples collected in contrasting locations in the southeastern US were analyzed for a host of aerosol species, along with AA and DTT activities. We present a detailed contrast in findings from these two assays. Water-soluble AA activity was higher in summer and fall than in winter, with highest levels near heavily trafficked highways, whereas DTT activity was higher in winter compared to summer and fall and more spatially homogeneous. AA activity was nearly exclusively correlated with water-soluble Cu (r Combining double low line 0.70\&ndash;0.94 at most sites), whereas DTT activity was correlated with organic and metal species. Source apportionment models, positive matrix factorization (PMF) and a chemical mass balance method with ensemble-averaged source impact profiles (CMB-E), suggest a strong contribution from traffic emissions and secondary processes (e.g., organic aerosol oxidation or metals mobilization by secondary acids) to both AA and DTT activities in urban Atlanta. In contrast, biomass burning was a large source for DTT activity, but insignificant for AA. AA activity was not correlated with PM2.5 mass, while DTT activity co-varied strongly with mass (r Combining double low line 0.49\&ndash;0.86 across sites and seasons). Various linear models were developed to estimate AA and DTT activities for the central Atlanta Jefferson Street site, based on the CMB-E sources. The models were then used to estimate daily oxidative potential at this site over the 1998\&ndash;2009 period. Time series epidemiological analyses were conducted to assess daily emergency department (ED) visits data for the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area based on the estimated 10-year backcast oxidative potential. Estimated AA activity was not statistically associated with any tested health outcome, while DTT activity was associated with ED visits for both asthma or wheeze and congestive heart failure. The findings point to the importance of both organic components and transition metals from biomass burning and mobile sources to adverse health outcomes in this region.}

  abstract = {The chemical composition of nonrefractory submicron aerosol particles was measured at the Puy-de-Dôme (PUY) station (1,465 m a.s.l) during 2015 using a Time-of-Flight Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ToF-ACSM). These aerosol chemistry measurements are combined with online black carbon (BC) measurements to provide an overview of the submicron aerosol composition. Averaged over the entire year, and normalized to standard temperature and pressure, organic aerosol (OA) dominates the PM1 concentration during all seasons and within all air mass types (2.12 ± 1.73 µgm−3), and is responsible for summertime increases in aerosol concentration. Highest mass concentrations were measured during the summer, when air masses were arriving over mainland Europe and lowest in the winter months (when most air masses were of Atlantic origin). OA source apportionment was performed separately during each season, using the Source Finder (SoFi) interface for the multilinear engine. The PUY site, situated at 1,465 m a.s.l, although mainly sampling in the atmospheric boundary layer, it is sometimes sampling in the lower free troposphere (FT), providing the opportunity to identify the characteristics of FT aerosol. In order to accurately identify these sampling periods, the methodology described in Farah et al. (2018), during the same time period (2015/2016), was applied to the data. During this period, FT air masses are sampled approximately 20\% of the time. This work provides, on one hand, a description of long-term aerosol chemical properties at a remote regional site in central Europe and, on the other hand a characteristic chemical signature of FT aerosols over this region. This data can be used to improve our understanding of the transport and aging properties of aerosols at regional observation sites.},

  abstract = {Biomass burning and secondary organic aerosols formed by photochemical reactions lead to the highest oxidative potential among urban emission sources and therefore are one of the most hazardous sources in terms of ambient PM toxicity.           ,                             In this study, we investigated the impact of urban emission sources on the chemical composition of ambient particulate matter (PM) as well as the associated oxidative potential. We collected six sets of PM samples in five urban location sites around the world over long time periods varying from weeks to months, intentionally selected for their PM to be dominated by unique emission sources: (1) PM               2.5               produced mainly by traffic emissions in central Los Angeles, United States (US); (2) PM               2.5               dominated by biomass burning in Milan, Italy; (3) PM               2.5               formed by secondary photochemical reactions thus dominated by secondary aerosols in Athens, Greece; (4) PM               10               emitted by refinery and dust resuspension in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (SA); (5) PM               10               generated by dust storms in Riyadh, SA, and (6) PM               2.5               produced mainly by industrial and traffic emissions in Beirut, Lebanon. The PM samples were chemically analyzed and their oxidative potential were quantified by employing the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay. Our results revealed that the Milan samples were rich in water soluble organic carbon (WSOC) and PAHs, even exceeding the levels measured on Los Angeles (LA) freeways. The PM in Athens was characterized by high concentrations of inorganic ions, specifically sulfate which was the highest of all PM samples. The ambient PM in LA was impacted by the traffic-emitted primary organic and elemental carbon. Furthermore, the contribution of metals and elements per mass of PM in Riyadh and Beirut samples were more pronounced relative to other sampling areas. The highest intrinsic PM redox activity was observed for PM with the highest WSOC fraction, including Milan (biomass burning) and Athens (secondary organic aerosols, SOA). PM in areas characterized by high metal emissions including dust events, refinery and industry, such as Riyadh and Beirut, had the lowest oxidative potential as assessed by the DTT assay. The results of this study illustrate the impact of major emission sources in urban areas on the redox activity and oxidative potential of ambient PM, providing useful information for developing efficient air pollution control and mitigation policies in polluted areas around the globe.},

  abstract = {Little is known about the main sources of ambient particulate matter (PM) in the 22 Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) countries. We designed this study to systematically review all published and unpublished source apportionment (SA), identification and characterization studies as well as emission inventories in the EMR. Of 440 articles identified, 82 (11 emission inventory ones) met our inclusion criteria for final analyses. Of 22 EMR countries, Iran with 30 articles had the highest number of studies on source specific PM followed by Pakistan (n = 15 articles) and Saudi Arabia (n = 8 papers). By contrast, there were no studies in Afghanistan, Bahrain, Djibouti, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen. Approximately 72\% of studies (51) were published within a span of 2015–2021.48 studies identified the sources of PM2.5 and its constituents. Positive matrix factorization (PMF), principal component analysis (PCA) and chemical mass balance (CMB) were the most common approaches to identify the source contributions of ambient PM. Both secondary aerosols and dust, with 12–51\% and 8–80\% (33\% and 30\% for all EMR countries, on average) had the greatest contributions in ambient PM2.5. The remaining sources for ambient PM2.5, including mixed sources (traffic, industry and residential (TIR)), traffic, industries, biomass burning, and sea salt were in the range of approximately 4–69\%, 4–49\%, 1–53\%, 7–25\% and 3–29\%, respectively. For PM10, the most dominant source was dust with 7–95\% (49\% for all EMR countries, on average). The limited number of SA studies in the EMR countries (one study per approximately 9.6 million people) in comparison to Europe and North America (1 study per 4.3 and 2.1 million people respectively) can be augmented by future studies that will provide a better understanding of emission sources in the urban environment.},

  abstract = {The emission of organic aerosols (OA) in the ambient air by residential wood burning is nowadays a subject of great scientific concern and a growing number of studies aim at apportioning the influence of such emissions on urban air quality. In the present study, results obtained using two commonly-used source apportionment models, i.e., Chemical Mass Balance (CMB, performed with off-line filter measurements) and Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF, applied to Aerosol Mass Spectrometer measurements), as well as using the recently-proposed Aethalometer model (based on the measurement of the aerosol light absorption at different wavelengths) are inter-compared. This work is performed using field data obtained during the winter season (14 to 29 January 2009) at an urban background site of a French Alpine city (Grenoble). Converging results from the different models indicate a major contribution of wood burning organic aerosols (OMwb) to the ambient aerosol organic fraction, with mean OM wb contributions to total OA of 68\%, 61\% and 37\% for the CMB, the Aethalometer and the AMS-PMF models respectively, during the period when the three modelling studies overlapped (12 days). Quantitative discrepancies might notably be due to the overestimation of OMwb calculated by the CMB due to the loss of semi-volatile compounds from sources to receptor site, as well as to the accounting of oxidized primary wood burning organic (OPOAwb) aerosols within the Oxygenated Organic Aerosol (OOA) PMF-factor. This OOA factor accounts on average for about 50\% of total OM, while non-combustion sources contribute to about 25\% and 28\% of total OM according to the CMB and Aethalometer models respectively. Each model suggests a mean contribution of fossil fuel emissions to total OM of about 10\%. A good agreement is also obtained for the source apportionment of elemental carbon (EC) by both the CMB and the Aethalometer models, with fossil fuel emissions representing on average more than 80\% of total EC. © Author(s) 2010.},

It results in strong collaborations with international-level academic partners for state-of-the-art, straightforward, and robust results and methodologies within operational air quality stakeholders (and subsequently, decision makers). Here, we illustrate some of the main outputs obtained over thelast decade, thanks to this program, regarding methodological aspects (both in terms of measurement techniques and data treatment procedures) as well as acquired knowledge on the predominant PM sources. Offline and online methods are used following well-suited quality assurance and quality control procedures, notably including inter-laboratory comparison exercises. Source apportionment studies are conducted using various receptor modeling approaches. Overall, the results presented herewith underline the major influences of residential wood burning (during the cold period) and road transport emissions (exhaust and non-exhaust ones, all throughout the year), as well as substantial contributions of mineral dust and primary biogenic particles (mostly during the warm period). Long-range transport phenomena, e.g., advection of secondary inorganic aerosols from the European continental sector and of Saharan dust into the FrenchWest Indies, are also discussed in this paper. Finally, we briefly address the use of stable isotope measurements (15N) and of various organic molecular markers for a better understanding of the origins of ammonium and of the different organic aerosol fractions, respectively.},

  abstract = {Positive matrix factorization (PMF) is a commonly used receptor model for PM2.5 source apportionment, relying on tracers to identify emission sources. Adding organic tracers such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to PMF model could enhance the performance of constraining emission sources. In this study, the PMF with PAHs was applied to 112 PM2.5 samples, including full-year and haze episodes during 2015–2016 in Shanghai. Compared to the original PMF, the PMF with PAHs newly identified the industry source and revised of the contributions of biomass burning and coal combustion. The PMF with PAHs were used to reconstruct the source apportionment of PM2.5 in four winter haze episodes. Taking the first two haze episodes (defined as P1and P2) as examples of frequent air mass changes, the P1 accumulation stage was successively affected by local and northwest sources. Vehicle (35.3\%) and secondary particles (25.7\%) were the primary contributors to PM2.5, due to local accumulation. Industry sources obtained a 25.9\% increment under the effect from the northwest sources. P2 was successively controlled by the southwest and northwest sources from the clean stage to the dissipation stage. Significantly increased contributions of biomass burning and industry sources to PM2.5 were observed. Compared to other episodes, the P2 accumulation stage had the highest coal-combustion proportion (5.6\%) under the influence of the northwest sources from Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Henan. Moreover, the toxicities of different emission sources were evaluated based on PAHs and BaPeq. Coal combustion, biomass burning, and vehicle sources were the three major contributors, especially coal combustion, contributing 17.1–66.8\% to PAHs and 22.6–66.4\% to BaPeq but less than 5.6\% to PM2.5. We believe that these results will help policymakers by providing insights into the reduction in emission sources for regulation in urban environments and the mitigation of health risks.},

  abstract = {Data scarcity caused by extreme conditions during storms adds difficulties in performing pollution source apportionment. This study integrated nonnegative matrix factorization with the imputation method (NMF-IM) to fill in missing data (NAs) and conduct source apportionment. A total of 367 river samples and 35 runoff samples were taken from the Banqiao and Nanfei River basins located in Hefei, China, during four rainfall events from June to August 2020. Sixteen indicators were quantified and used for source diagnostics using NMF-IM. The results showed that total phosphorus (TP) had higher concentrations and more violent fluctuations than total nitrogen (TN) in river samples taken from rain. NMF-IM was shown to recover the value distribution of NAs approximately. The source profiles and contribution rates calculated by NMF-IM with NAs were close to the original results calculated by NMF without NAs, with root mean square error of less than 2.3\% and differences less than 9.5\%. Multiple forms of nitrogen and phosphorus indicators benefit reaching reasonable source diagnostics results. At least four indicators were needed to reach the same contribution rates as 16 indicator diagnostics. The two good indicator combination groups are nitrate (NO3–N), nitrite (NO2–N), ammonia nitrogen (NH3–N), and total suspended solids (TSS) and NO3–N, NO2–N, phosphorus (PO4–P), and TSS. The pollution source contributions changed with the Antecedent dry period (ADPs) of rain events. Treated tailwater and untreated sewage were major sources, contributing more than 80\% of the total pollution of the rainstorm events with short ADPs. Dust wash became the dominant contributor after 60 min and contributed 36\% of the total pollution of rainstorm events with long ADPs. The average source contribution rates for rainfall events in the Banqiao River were treated tailwater (41\%) {$>$} untreated sewage (27\%) {$>$} dust wash (19\%) {$>$} other sources (16\%). The pollution source diagnostics results were verified to be reasonable by simulation using tested run-off data and literature results.},

Three mature receptor models, namely, principal component analysis-multiple linear regression (PCA-MLR), positive matrix factorization (PMF) and factor analysis with nonnegative constraints (FA-NNC), were comparatively employed for source apportionment of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in 30 street dust samples. The results indicated that the FA-NNC and PMF models produced results with a higher degree of similarity than the results obtained with the PCA-MLR model. Moreover, when the sample size was gradually decreased, similar source profiles were extracted that were consistent with results obtained from all samples. However, the overall contribution rates were not as stable as the source profiles. The PCA-MLR results remained the most stable in both aspects. FA-NNC and PMF performed better in regards to the stability of contribution rates and source profiles, respectively. Improvements in the goodness of fit of overall and individual pollutants were always accompanied by a decrease in the relevance among the variables, indicating that while the model simulation effect was improved, the credibility of the results decreased. Thus, finding an appropriate number of sample size is more appropriate than simply involving too many samples in source apportionment models.},

  abstract = {Background: Maternal exposure to fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5) during pregnancy has been linked to lower newborn birthweight, making it a toxic exposure because lower birthweight is a risk factor for chronic disease and mortality. However, the toxicity of major constituents of PM2.5 and how they compare to each other remain uncertain. Methods: We assigned address-specific exposure to PM2.5, elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC), nitrate, and sulfate averaged over the entire period of pregnancy for each birth in Massachusetts from 2001 to 2012 using a high-resolution exposure model. Using multivariate regression adjusted for total PM2.5, we estimated the relative toxicity of each constituent on continuous birthweight. Results: EC was more toxic per interquartile range increase compared with remaining PM2.5 in single constituent models that estimated the effect of a constituent with adjustment for PM2.5. OC, nitrate, and sulfate were each less toxic than their respective remaining PM2.5 per interquartile range increase. When all constituents and total PM2.5 were included in the same model, EC was most toxic, followed by nitrate, then OC and sulfate with similar toxicities. Sensitivity analyses using term low birth weight and small for gestational age also showed that EC was most detrimental as did averaging exposures over the third trimester of pregnancy. Scaling to unit mass increases also showed EC to be most toxic. Conclusion: Four major constituents of PM2.5 had different relative toxicities on continuous birthweight. Our findings suggest that EC was most toxic, followed by nitrate, OC, and sulfate.},

  abstract = {Particulate matter from wood burning emissions (Cwood) was quantified at five locations in the United Kingdom (UK), comprising three rural and two urban sites between 2009 and 2021. The aethalometer method was used. Mean winter Cwood concentrations ranged from 0.26 μg m−3 (in rural Scotland) to 1.30 μg m−3 (London), which represented on average 4\% (in rural environments) and 5\% (urban) of PM10 concentrations; and 8\% of PM2.5. Concentrations were greatest in the evenings in winter months, with larger evening concentrations in the weekends at the urban sites. Random-forest (RF) machine learning regression models were used to reconstruct Cwood concentrations using both meteorological and temporal explanatory variables at each site. The partial dependency plots indicated that temperature and wind speed were the meteorological variables explaining the greatest variability in Cwood, with larger concentrations during cold and calm conditions. Peaks of Cwood concentrations took place during and after events that are celebrated with bonfires. These were Guy Fawkes events in the urban areas and on New Year's Day at the rural sites; the later probably related to long-range transport. Time series were built using the RF. Having removed weather influences, long-term trends of Cwood were estimated using the Theil Sen method. Trends for 2015–2021 were downward at three of the locations (London, Glasgow and rural Scotland), with rates ranging from −5.5\% year−1 to −2.5\% year−1. The replacement of old fireplaces with lower emission wood stoves might explain the decrease in Cwood especially at the urban sites The two rural sites in England observed positive trends for the same period but this was not statistically significant.},

To disentangle the influence of weather, long-range transport, and the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere, boosted regression tree (BRT) models were built at each site; and normalised time series were calculated by randomising the value of the explanatory variables at a given time. Different BRT models were formulated and two types of normalised PM2.5 time series were calculated: de-weathered time series (without the influence of the meteorological and long-range transport) and de-weathered \&amp; de-oxidised time series (randomisation of meteorology, transport and OX (NO2 + O3) levels). Over the studied period, PM2.5 concentrations decreased at approximatively -5\% year-1, almost 1.5 times faster than changes in primary emissions in France. Overall trends in de-weathered, and de-weathered and de-oxidised PM2.5 concentrations were lower than trends in PM2.5 observations for the same period, at -3.9\% year-1 and -3.2 \% year-1, respectively. Trends in de-weathered \&amp; de-oxidised PM2.5 were close to those in emissions, demonstrating the importance of including variables capturing the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere in the normalising techniques to compare trends in PM2.5 with trends in primary emissions. Trends in observations of PM2.5 were consistent with trends in nitrate particles from reduced NOX emissions, and to trends in ammonium particles and biomass burning.},

  abstract = {Chemically resolved atmospheric aerosol data sets from the largest intercomparison of the Aerodyne aerosol chemical speciation monitors (ACSMs) performed to date were collected at the French atmospheric supersite SIRTA. In total 13 quadrupole ACSMs (Q-ACSM) from the European ACTRIS ACSM network, one time-of-flight ACSM (ToF-ACSM), and one high-resolution ToF aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) were operated in parallel for about 3 weeks in November and December∼2013. Part 1 of this study reports on the accuracy and precision of the instruments for all the measured species. In this work we report on the intercomparison of organic components and the results from factor analysis source apportionment by positive matrix factorisation (PMF) utilising the multilinear engine 2 (ME-2). Except for the organic contribution of mass-to-charge ratio m/z 44 to the total organics (f{$<$}inf{$>$}44{$<$}/inf{$>$}), which varied by factors between 0.6 and 1.3 compared to the mean, the peaks in the organic mass spectra were similar among instruments. The m/z 44 differences in the spectra resulted in a variable f{$<$}inf{$>$}44{$<$}/inf{$>$} in the source profiles extracted by ME-2, but had only a minor influence on the extracted mass contributions of the sources. The presented source apportionment yielded four factors for all 15 instruments: hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol (HOA), cooking-related organic aerosol (COA), biomass burning-related organic aerosol (BBOA) and secondary oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA). ME-2 boundary conditions (profile constraints) were optimised individually by means of correlation to external data in order to achieve equivalent / comparable solutions for all ACSM instruments and the results are discussed together with the investigation of the influence of alternative anchors (reference profiles). A comparison of the ME-2 source apportionment output of all 15 instruments resulted in relative standard deviations (SD) from the mean between 13.7 and 22.7 \% of the source's average mass contribution depending on the factors (HOA: 14.3 ± 2.2 \%, COA: 15.0 ± 3.4 \%, OOA: 41.5 ± 5.7 \%, BBOA: 29.3 ± 5.0 \%). Factors which tend to be subject to minor factor mixing (in this case COA) have higher relative uncertainties than factors which are recognised more readily like the OOA. Averaged over all factors and instruments the relative first SD from the mean of a source extracted with ME-2 was 17.2 \%.},

  abstract = {Sugars are important water-soluble organic constituents of atmospheric particulate matter (PM). In order to better understand the sources and seasonal variations of sugars in aerosols, primary saccharides (fructose, glucose, sucrose, and trehalose) and sugar alcohols (arabitol and mannitol), together with levoglucosan, have been studied in ambient aerosols at Gosan, Jeju Island in the western North Pacific, the downwind region of the Asian outflow, using gas chromatographyemass spectrometry. The results showed that the sugar composition varied seasonally with a total concentration range of 6.8e1760 ng m 3 (mean 246 ng m 3). The total identified sugars had the highest concentration in April, the spring bloom season at Jeju Island, when sucrose contributed up to 80\% of the total sugars. The dominance of sucrose was also detected in pollen samples, suggesting that pollen can contribute significantly to sucrose in aerosols during the spring bloom. The seasonal variation of trehalose is consistent with those of non-seasalt Ca2þ and d13C of total carbon with elevated levels during the Asian dust storm events. This study indicates that sugar compounds in atmospheric PM over East Asia can be derived from biomass burning, Asian dust, and primary biological aerosols such as fungal spores and pollen. Furthermore, this study supports the idea that sucrose could be used as a tracer for airborne pollen grains, and trehalose as a tracer for Asian dust outflow.},

The field campaign encompassed the Swiss National Day fireworks event, providing increased concentrations and unique chemical signatures compared to non-fireworks (or background) periods. The objective was to evaluate the data quality by intercomparison with other independent measurements and test its applicability for aerosol source quantification. The Xact was configured to measure 24 elements in PM10 with 1g h time resolution. Data quality was evaluated for 10 24g h averages of Xact data by intercomparison with 24g h PM10 filter data analysed with ICP-OES for major elements, ICP-MS for trace elements, and gold amalgamation atomic absorption spectrometry for Hg. Ten elements (S, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Ba, Pb) showed excellent correlation between the compared methods, with r2 values ≥ g 0.95. However, the slopes of the regressions between Xact 625 and ICP data varied from 0.97 to 1.8 (average 1.28) and thus indicated generally higher Xact elemental concentrations than ICP for these elements. Possible reasons for these differences are discussed, but further investigations are needed. For the remaining elements no conclusions could be drawn about their quantification for various reasons, mainly detection limit issues. An indirect intercomparison of hourly values was performed for the fireworks peak, which brought good agreement of total masses when the Xact data were corrected with the regressions from the 24g h value intercomparison. The results demonstrate that multi-metal characterization at high-time-resolution capability of Xact is a valuable and practical tool for ambient monitoring.}

First applications in the field reveal its practicability and applicability to determine the PM2.5/PM10 ratio.

Simulations of the uncertainty caused by alternating sampling of the two size classes show that the increase of uncertainty is within acceptable limits, depending on the characteristics of the time series.

  abstract = {The literature on atmospheric particulate matter (PM), or atmospheric aerosol, has increased enormously over the last 2 decades and amounts now to some 1500-2000 papers per year in the refereed literature. This is in part due to the enormous advances in measurement technologies, which have allowed for an increasingly accurate understanding of the chemical composition and of the physical properties of atmospheric particles and of their processes in the atmosphere. The growing scientific interest in atmospheric aerosol particles is due to their high importance for environmental policy. In fact, particulate matter constitutes one of the most challenging problems both for air quality and for climate change policies. In this context, this paper reviews the most recent results within the atmospheric aerosol sciences and the policy needs, which have driven much of the increase in monitoring and mechanistic research over the last 2 decades. The synthesis reveals many new processes and developments in the science underpinning climate-aerosol interactions and effects of PM on human health and the environment. However, while airborne particulate matter is responsible for globally important influences on premature human mortality, we still do not know the relative importance of the different chemical components of PM for these effects. Likewise, the magnitude of the overall effects of PM on climate remains highly uncertain. Despite the uncertainty there are many things that could be done to mitigate local and global problems of atmospheric PM. Recent analyses have shown that reducing black carbon (BC) emissions, using known control measures, would reduce global warming and delay the time when anthropogenic effects on global temperature would exceed 2°C. Likewise, cost-effective control measures on ammonia, an important agricultural precursor gas for secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA), would reduce regional eutrophication and PM concentrations in large areas of Europe, China and the USA. Thus, there is much that could be done to reduce the effects of atmospheric PM on the climate and the health of the environment and the human population. A prioritized list of actions to mitigate the full range of effects of PM is currently undeliverable due to shortcomings in the knowledge of aerosol science; among the shortcomings, the roles of PM in global climate and the relative roles of different PM precursor sources and their response to climate and land use change over the remaining decades of this century are prominent. In any case, the evidence from this paper strongly advocates for an integrated approach to air quality and climate policies.}

  abstract = {Air quality management regarding PM concentrations in the atmosphere is a complex problem to tackle. In this paper, we aim to characterize the temporal patterns and trends of aerosol background levels over Portugal. Hourly data from the national air quality monitoring network, gathered from 2007 to 2016, is analyzed using statistical methods. Data from 20 monitoring stations was processed to prepare datasets with different time scales, and results were grouped by their type of surrounding area (urban, suburban, or rural). Urban and suburban background sites are characterized by strong seasonal patterns, with higher monthly mean concentrations in winter than in summer. In contrast, rural background PM10 concentrations are highest during August and September. This study suggests that urban background concentrations are significantly influenced by anthropogenic non-combustion sources, which contribute to the coarser aerosol fraction (PMc). PMc is about 3 μg m−3 higher during weekdays than during Sundays, at urban sites. However, there is no clear relationship between the value of the PM2.5/PMc ratio and the type of monitoring station. During the 10-year period of study, a decrease of 1.83, 3.58, and 4.89\%/year was registered in PM10 concentrations at Portuguese rural, urban, and suburban areas, respectively. Despite the higher decrease at suburban monitoring stations, those sites present the highest 10-year mean PM10 concentrations. This work provides an import insight on temporal variations of PM10, PM2.5, and PMc concentrations over Portugal and summarizes trends through the last decade, contributing to the discussion on sources and processes influencing those concentrations.},

The elevated concentrations of several toxic trace elements (As, Cd, Mn, Ni, Pb, etc.) in particles revealed that the contamination of toxic elements in Beijing could not be neglected. Positive matrix factorization method (PMF) was applied for source apportionment of trace elements in PM, and three factors (crust related sources, combustion sources, and traffic and steel industrial related sources) were identified. Furthermore, the chemical speciation and bioavailability of various elements were identified by applying European Community Bureau of Reference (BCR) procedure. Our results showed that eight toxic elements (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Sb and Zn) exhibited higher mobility in PM2.5 than in PM10. Notably, elements of As, Cd, Pb and Zn were presented with higher mobility than the other elements, and these elements were lightly to release into the environment and easily available to human body. Additionally, As, Cd, Pb and Zn also accounted for higher percentages in the bound to mobile fractions at the central urban areas of Beijing. Therefore, special concerns should be paid to these toxic trace elements which had relatively high mobility in fine particles, when planning and implementing the comprehensive air pollution mitigation policies in Beijing.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The capability of ambient particles to generate in vivo reactive oxygen species (ROS), called oxidative potential (OP), is a potential metric for evaluating the health effects of particulate matter (PM) and is supported by several recent epidemiological investigations. Studies using various types of OP assays differ in their sensitivities to varying PM chemical components. In this study, we systematically compared two health-relevant acellular OP assays that track the depletion of antioxidants or reductant surrogates: (i)~the synthetic respiratory-tract lining fluid (RTLF) assay that tracks the depletion of ascorbic acid (AA) and glutathione (GSH) and (ii)~the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay that tracks the depletion of DTT. Yearlong daily samples were collected at an urban site in Atlanta, GA (Jefferson Street), during 2017, and both DTT and RTLF assays were performed to measure the OP of water-soluble PM2.5 components. PM2.5 mass and major chemical components, including metals, ions, and organic and elemental carbon were also analyzed. Correlation analysis found that OP as measured by the DTT and AA depletion (OPDTT and OPAA, respectively) were correlated with both organics and some water-soluble metal species, whereas that from the GSH depletion (OPGSH) was exclusively sensitive to water-soluble Cu. These OP assays were moderately correlated with each other due to the common contribution from metal ions. OPDTT and OPAA were moderately correlated with PM2.5 mass with Pearson's r=0.55 and 0.56, respectively, whereas OPGSH exhibited a lower correlation (r=0.24). There was little seasonal variation in the OP levels for all assays due to the weak seasonality of OP-associated species. Multivariate linear regression models were developed to predict OP measures from the particle composition data. Variability in OPDTT and OPAA were not only attributed to the concentrations of metal ions (mainly Fe and Cu) and organic compounds but also to antagonistic metal–organic and metal–metal interactions. OPGSH was sensitive to the change in water-soluble Cu and brown carbon (BrC), a proxy for ambient humic-like substances.},

  abstract = {Exposure to ambient air pollution has an adverse influence on human health. There is increasing evidence that oxidative potential (OP), the capacity of airborne pollutants to oxidize target molecules by generating redox oxidizing species, is a plausible metric for particulate matter (PM) toxicity. Here we describe the commonly used acellular techniques for measuring OP (respiratory tract lining fluid, dithiothreitol, ascorbic acid, and electron paramagnetic resonance assays) and review the PM chemical constituents that have been identified to drive the OP response. We further perform a review of the epidemiologic literature to identify studies that reported an association between exposure to ambient PM and a health outcome in a human population, and in which exposure was measured by both PM mass concentration and OP. Laboratory studies have shown that specific redox-active metals and quinones are able to contribute OP directly. However, interactions among PM species may alter the redox properties of PM components. In ambient PM measurements, all OP assays were found to be correlated with metals (Fe, Cu) and organic species (photochemically aged organics). Across the epidemiological studies reviewed, associations between fine PM (PM2.5) mass and cardio-respiratory outcomes were found to be stronger at elevated OP levels but findings varied across the different OP measurement techniques. Future work should aim to identify specific situations in which PM OP can improve air pollution exposure assessment and/or risk management. This may be particularly useful in countries with low PM2.5 mass concentrations over broad spatial scales where such information may greatly improve the efficiency of risk management activities.},

For the 2008/2009 period, it was found that secondary aerosols (sulphate- and nitrate-rich secondary aerosols, SSA and NSA) are the most abundant components of PM10 at sites north of the Alps. Road traffic and wood combustion were found to be the largest sources of PM10 at these sites. Except at the urban roadside site where road traffic is dominating (40\% of PM10 -- including road salt), the annual average contribution of these two sources is of similar importance (17\% and 14\% of PM10, respectively). At a rural site south of the Alps wood combustion and road traffic contributions to PM10 were higher (31\% and 24\%, respectively), and the fraction of secondary aerosols lower (29\%) than at similar site types north of the Alps.Comparison of PMF analyses for the two time periods (1998/1999 and 2008/2009) revealed decreasing average contributions of road traffic and SSA to PM10 at all sites. This indicates that the measures that were implemented in Switzerland and in neighbouring countries to reduce emissions of sulphur dioxide and PM10 from road traffic were successful. On the other hand, contributions of wood combustion did not change during this ten year period, and the contribution of nitrate-rich secondary aerosols has even increased. It is shown that PMF can be a helpful tool for the assessment of long-term changes of source contributions to ambient particulate matter. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Using positive matrix factorization (PMF) and comparing source contributions at Allen Park to those in Dearborn, contributions made by local industrial sources (power plants, coke refineries, iron smelting, waste incineration), local area sources (automobile and diesel truck) and long range sources of PM2.5 can be distinguished in greater Detroit. Overall, the mean mass concentration measured at Dearborn was 19\% higher than that measured at Allen Park. The mass at Allen Park was apportioned as: secondary sulfate 31\%, secondary nitrate 28\%, soil 8\%, mixed aged sea and road salts 4\%, gasoline 15\%, diesel 4\%, and biomass burning 3\%. At Dearborn the mass was apportioned as: secondary sulfate 25\%, secondary nitrate 20\%, soil 12\%, mixed aged sea and road salts 4\%, gasoline 20\%, diesel 8\%, iron and steel, 5\%, and mixed industrial 7\%. The impact of the iron and steel, soil, and mixed aged sea and road salt was much higher at the Dearborn site than at the Allen Park site, suggesting that close proximity to a local industrial complex has a direct negative impact on local air quality.},

Low volume PM2.5 and PM1 samplers are utilised together with a low volume optical analyser, enabling the intercomparison between the measurements obtained by the gravimetrical and the optical method. The concentration levels observed at the different sites are compared in order to point out intra-site seasonal differences and inter-site differences for corresponding seasons of the year. These different concentration levels are analysed and explained considering the exposure to the primary emissions and accounting for the role of meteorology. PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 are described in terms of the distribution of 1-h concentration data and their relative mass fractions are determined. In order to assess the significance of secondary sources of fine particulate, a PM2.5 high volume sampler is utilised for the collection of dust-loaded filters to be analysed for chemical characterisation. The composition of PM2.5 emission from traffic is investigated by analysing 24h samples from an urban tunnel site (TU): data on carbonaceous species, organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC), are obtained and the ratio between these species is evaluated for real traffic emissions. Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) contribution to PM2.5 mass in ambient air is assessed by means of the primary OC/EC ratio approach, based on chemical data of the filters from the TU. Organic and inorganic secondary production in the outdoor atmosphere is contributing for about 75\% of PM2.5 mass in winter and 40\% in summer: as a consequence, effective long-term actions, still controlling the emissions of primary pollutants too, are required for air quality standards attainment and the potentiality of short-term interventions, as traffic restriction, appears quite limited.},

The backpack mobile monitoring platform was used for the determination of equivalent black carbon (eBC) and particulate matter (PM) mass concentrations along the hollow. To ensure high quality of mobile measurement data, intercomparisons of mobile instruments with reference instruments were performed at two air quality stations during every run. Our study showed that aerosol pollution events in the relief depression were associated with high local emission intensities originating almost entirely from residential wood burning and shallow temperature inversions (58m on average). The eBC and PM mass concentrations showed stronger associations with the potential temperature gradient (R2Combining double low line0.8) than with any other meteorological parameters taken into account (ambient temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and precipitation). The strong association between the potential temperature gradient and pollutant concentrations suggests that even a small number of emission sources (total 243 households in the studied hollow) in similar hilly and mountainous rural areas with frequent temperature inversions can significantly increase the levels of eBC and PM and deteriorate local air quality. During temperature inversions the measured mean eBC and PM2.5 mass concentrations in the whole hollow were as high as 4.5±2.6 and 48.0±27.7μgm-3, respectively, which is comparable to larger European urban centres.}

  abstract = {As the incidence of respiratory and allergic symptoms has been reported to be increased in children attending schools in close proximity to busy roads, it was hypothesised that PM from roadside schools would display enhanced oxidative potential (OP). Two consecutive one-week air quality monitoring campaigns were conducted at seven school sampling sites, reflecting roadside and urban background in London. Chemical characteristics of size fractionated particulate matter (PM) samples were related to the capacity to drive biological oxidation reactions in a synthetic respiratory tract lining fluid. Contrary to hypothesised contrasts in particulate OP between school site types, no robust size-fractionated differences in OP were identified due high temporal variability in concentrations of PM components over the one-week sampling campaigns. For OP assessed both by ascorbate (OP AA m -3) and glutathione (OP GSH m -3) depletion, the highest OP per cubic metre of air was in the largest size fraction, PM 1.9-10.2. However, when expressed per unit mass of particles OP AA μg -1 showed no significant dependence upon particle size, while OP GSH μg -1 had a tendency to increase with increasing particle size, paralleling increased concentrations of Fe, Ba and Cu. The two OP metrics were not significantly correlated with one another, suggesting that the glutathione and ascorbate depletion assays respond to different components of the particles. Ascorbate depletion per unit mass did not show the same dependence as for GSH and it is possible that other trace metals (Zn, Ni, V) or organic components which are enriched in the finer particle fractions, or the greater surface area of smaller particles, counter-balance the redox activity of Fe, Ba and Cu in the coarse particles. Further work with longer-term sampling and a larger suite of analytes is advised in order to better elucidate the determinants of oxidative potential, and to fuller explore the contrasts between site types. © 2011 Godri et al.}

  abstract = {A class of organic molecules extracted from atmospheric aerosol particles and isolated from fog and cloud water has been termed HUmic-LIke Substances (HULIS) due to a certain resemblance to terrestrial and aquatic humic and fulvic acids. In light of the interest that this class of atmospheric compounds currently attracts, we comprehensively review HULIS properties, as well as laboratory and field investigations concerning their formation and characterization in atmospheric samples. While sharing some important features such as polyacidic nature, accumulating evidence suggests that atmospheric HULIS differ substantially from terrestrial and aquatic humic substances. Major differences between HULIS and humic substances, including smaller average molecular weight, lower aromatic moiety content, greater surface activity, better droplet activation ability, as well as others, are highlighted. Several alternatives are proposed that may explain such differences: (1) the possibility that mono-and di-carboxylic acids and mineral acids abundant in the atmosphere prevent the formation of large humic "supramolecular associations"; (2) that large humic macromolecules are destroyed in the atmosphere by UV radiation , O 3 , and OH − radicals; 3) that "HULIS" actually consists of a complex, unresolved mixture of relatively small molecules rather than macromolecular entities; and (4) that HULIS formed via abiotic and short-lived oxidative reaction pathways differ substantially from humic substances formed over long time periods via biologically-mediated reactions. It should also be recalled that the vast majority of studies of HULIS relate to the water soluble fraction, which would include only the fulvic acid fraction of humic substances, and exclude the humic acid (base-soluble) and humin (insoluble) fractions of humic substances. A significant effort towards Correspondence to: E. R. Graber (ergraber@volcani.agri.gov.il) adopting standard extraction and characterization methods is required to develop a better and meaningful comparison between different HULIS samples.},

  abstract = {Particulate matter (PM) is the air pollutant that causes the greatest deleterious health effects across the world, so PM is routinely monitored within air quality networks, usually in respect to PM mass or number in different size fractions. However, such measurements do not provide information on the biological toxicity of PM. Oxidative potential (OP) is a complementary metric that aims to classify PM in respect to its oxidising ability in the lungs and is being increasingly reported due to its assumed relevance concerning human health. Between June 2018 and May 2019, an intensive filter-based PM sampling campaign was conducted across Switzerland in five locations, which involved the quantification of a large number of PM constituents and the OP for both PM10 and PM2.5. OP was quantified by three assays: ascorbic acid (AA), dithiothreitol (DTT), and dichlorofluorescein (DCFH). OPv (OP by air volume) was found to be variable over time and space: Bern-Bollwerk, an urban-traffic sampling site, had the greatest levels of OPv among the Swiss sites (especially when considering OPvAA), with more rural locations such as Payerne experiencing a lower OPv. However, urban-background and suburban sites experienced a significant OPv enhancement, as did the rural Magadino-Cadenazzo site during wintertime because of high levels of wood smoke. The mean OP ranges for the sampling period were 0.4-4.1gnmolmin-1m-3, 0.6-3.0gnmolmin-1m-3, and 0.3-0.7gnmolH2O2m-3 for OPvAA, OPvDTT, and OPvDCFH, respectively. A source allocation method using positive matrix factorisation (PMF) models indicated that although all PM10 and PM2.5 sources that were identified contributed to OPv, the anthropogenic road traffic and wood combustion sources had the greatest OPm potency (OP per PM mass) on average. A dimensionality reduction procedure coupled to multiple linear regression modelling consistently identified a handful of metals usually associated with non-exhaust emissions, namely copper, zinc, iron, tin, antimony, manganese, and cadmium, as well as three specific wood-burning-sourced organic tracers - levoglucosan, mannosan, and galactosan (or their metal substitutes: rubidium and potassium), as the most important PM components to explain and predict OPv. The combination of a metal and a wood-burning-specific tracer led to the best-performing linear models to explain OPv. Interestingly, within the non-exhaust and wood combustion emission groups, the exact choice of component was not critical; the models simply required a variable representing the emission source or process to be present. This analysis strongly suggests that anthropogenic and locally emitting road traffic and wood burning sources should be prioritised, targeted, and controlled to gain the most efficacious decrease in OPv and presumably biological harm reductions in Switzerland.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric particulate matter (PM) is a heterogeneous material. Though regulated as un-speciated mass, it exerts most effects on vegetation and ecosystems by virtue of the mass loading of its chemical constituents. As this varies temporally and spatially, prediction of regional impacts remains difficult. Deposition of PM to vegetated surfaces depends on the size distribution of the particles and, to a lesser extent, on the chemistry. However, chemical loading of an ecosystem may be determined by the size distribution as different constituents dominate different size fractions. Coating with dust may cause abrasion and radiative heating, and may reduce the photosynthetically active photon flux reaching the photosynthetic tissues. Acidic and alkaline materials may cause leaf surface injury while other materials may be taken up across the cuticle. A more likely route for metabolic uptake and impact on vegetation and ecosystems is through the rhizosphere. PM deposited directly to the soil can influence nutrient cycling, especially that of nitrogen, through its effects on the rhizosphere bacteria and fungi. Alkaline cation and aluminum availability are dependent upon the pH of the soil that may be altered dramatically by deposition of various classes of PM. A regional effect of PM on ecosystems is linked to climate change. Increased PM may reduce radiation interception by plant canopies and may reduce precipitation through a variety of physical effects. At the present time, evidence does not support large regional threats due to un-speciated PM, though site-specific and constituent-specific effects can be readily identified. Interactions of PM with other pollutants and with components of climate change remain important areas of research in assessment of challenges to ecosystem stability.},

Based on the chemical information, positive matrix factorization (PMF) was used to identify PM sources. A total of five source types were identified, including soil dust, vehicle emissions, sea salt, industrial emissions and secondary aerosols, and their contributions were estimated using PMF. The crustal enrichment factors (EF) were calculated using Al as a reference for the trace metal species to identify the sources. Conditional probability functions (CPF) were computed using wind profiles and factor contributions. The results of CPF analysis were used to identify local point sources.

  abstract = {Two types of samples were used to chemically characterize the Saharan end‐member: fine fractions of surface soil samples collected in Northern Africa and particulate phases of typical Saharan rains. Since the concentrations measured in the particulate phase of the Saharan rains were corrected from the dissolution losses in rainwater, these particles were considered to be representative of the transported Saharan dust before being blended into rainwater. Al, Fe, P, and Pb were analyzed: except for lead, the chemical composition of the transported Saharan dust was more homogeneous than the composition of individual soils. As confirmed by the air mass back trajectories, the higher level of homogeneity of the aerosol is partly due to the fact that a dust event affects a large area of the Saharan desert, and the composition of the particles reflects the average composition of the eroded areas. Pb concentration in the transported dust reflected an anthropogenic fraction. By using Pb/Al measurements from the soils it was shown that a typical Saharan rain event with no mixing with air masses from Europe appears to be very rare in the Mediterranean environment. The following values are proposed to characterize the Saharan dust end‐member: Al (\%) = 7.09 ± 0.79; Fe (\%) = 4.45 ± 0.49; P (\%) = 0.082 ± 0.011; Pb (ppm) = 24 ± 9. This study suggests that the [element/Al or Fe)] ratio is also useful to characterize the Saharan end‐member as they are very homogeneous for the two sample types. Saharan dust represents a potential source of nutrients (P, Fe) for the Mediterranean water. Indeed, it accounts for ∼30–40\% of the total atmospheric flux of phosphorus in the western Mediterranean, and it governs the biogeochemical cycle of iron being the main source of dissolved iron in the western Mediterranean waters.},

  abstract = {Receptor-oriented source apportionment models are often used to identify sources of ambient air pollutants and to estimate source contributions to air pollutant concentrations. In this study, a PCA/APCS model was applied to the data on non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) measured from January to December 2001 at two sampling sites: Tsuen Wan (TW) and Central \& Western (CW) Toxic Air Pollutants Monitoring Stations in Hong Kong. This multivariate method enables the identification of major air pollution sources along with the quantitative apportionment of each source to pollutant species. The PCA analysis identified four major pollution sources at TW site and five major sources at CW site. The extracted pollution sources included vehicular internal engine combustion with unburned fuel emissions, use of solvent particularly paints, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) or natural gas leakage, and industrial, commercial and domestic sources such as solvents, decoration, fuel combustion, chemical factories and power plants. The results of APCS receptor model indicated that 39\% and 48\% of the total NMHCs mass concentrations measured at CW and TW were originated from vehicle emissions, respectively. 32\% and 36.4\% of the total NMHCs were emitted from the use of solvent and 11\% and 19.4\% were apportioned to the LPG or natural gas leakage, respectively. 5.2\% and 9\% of the total NMHCs mass concentrations were attributed to other industrial, commercial and domestic sources, respectively. It was also found that vehicle emissions and LPG or natural gas leakage were the main sources of C3-C5 alkanes and C3-C5 alkenes while aromatics were predominantly released from paints. Comparison of source contributions to ambient NMHCs at the two sites indicated that the contribution of LPG or natural gas at CW site was almost twice that at TW site. High correlation coefficients (R2 {$>$} 0.8) between the measured and predicted values suggested that the PCA/APCS model was applicable for estimation of sources of NMHCs in ambient air. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Particulate matter (PM) oxidative potential (OP) is an emerging health metric, but studies examining the OP of indoor PM are rare. This paper focuses on the relationships between respiratory exposure to OP and PM water-soluble composition in indoor environments. Size-resolved PM samples were collected between November 2015 and June 2016 from an office, home (including bedroom, living room, and storeroom), and laboratory using a MOUDI sampler. Particles from each source were segregated into eleven size bins, and the water-soluble metal content and dithiothreitol (DTT) loss rate were measured in each PM extract. The water-soluble OP (OPws) of indoor PM was highest in the office and lowest in the home, varying by factors of up to 1.2; these variations were attributed to differences in occupation density, occupant activity, and ventilation. In addition, the particulate Cu, Mn, and Fe concentrations were closely correlated with OPws in indoor particles; the transition metals may have acted as catalysts during oxidation processes, inducing \$OH formation through the concomitant consumption of DTT. The OPws particle size distributions featured single modes with peaks between 0.18 and 3.2 mm across all indoor sites, reflecting the dominant contribution of PM3.2 to total PM levels and the enhanced oxidative activity of the PM3.2 compared to PM{$>$}3.2. Lung-deposition model calculations indicated that PM3.2 dominated the pulmonary deposition of the OPws ({$>$}75\%) due to both the high levels of metals content and the high deposition efficiency in the alveolar region. Therefore, because OPws has been directly linked to various health effects, special attention should be given to PM3.2.},

  abstract = {Backgrounds: Evidence is scarce on the relation between maternal exposure to ambient air pollution during pregnancy and fetal growth in developing countries. Moreover, the current evidence is inconsistent. We aimed to investigate the association of trimester-specific exposure to air pollution with risk of being born small for gestational age (SGA) and birth weight-markers of fetal growth-among Chinese term births. Methods: This retrospective population-based cohort study consisted of 2,567,457 singleton term live-births from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2017 across 123 Chinese districts and counties. Personal exposure to ambient air pollutants including carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter {$<$} 2.5 μm (PM2.5), and PM10 was assigned using the inverse distance weighting spatial interpolation algorithm. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) logistic regression models were performed to estimate the associations between trimester-specific exposure to air pollution and risk of SGA or low birth weight (LBW), and GEE linear regression to examine the associations between the exposure and term birth weight, adjusting for maternal demographics, maternal cigarette smoking status during pregnancy, mode of delivery, gravidity, gestational age, year and month of conception, neonate’s sex, and meteorological factors. Stratified and sensitivity analyses were also performed. Results: When mother exposed to ambient air pollutants over the entire pregnancy, per IQR increment (0.122 mg/m3) in ambient CO concentrations was associated with higher risk of SGA (odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.02, 1.05) and reduced birth weight among term births (−5.95 g, 95\% CI: −8.01, −3.89). This association was also pronounced in the second and third trimesters. Term birth weight was negatively associated with per IQR increase of O3 (−3.52 g, 95\% CI: −6.23, −0.81), PM2.5 (−5.93 g, 95\% CI: −8.36, −3.49) and PM10 (−7.78 g, 95\% CI: −10.41, −5.16) during the entire pregnancy, respectively. No significant association was detected between maternal exposure to air pollutants and term LBW. Effect estimates of heterogeneity suggested that maternal age and infant sex modified the impact of air pollution on birth weight. Conclusions: The findings suggest that maternal exposure to air pollution during pregnancy is adversely affecting fetal growth. Further studies are warranted to integrate these findings and take clinical or public health interventions in pregnancy.},

  abstract = {Background-—Epidemiological studies investigating the role of fine particulate matter (PM2.5; aerodynamic diameter {$<$}2.5 lm) in triggering acute coronary events, including out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and ischemic heart disease (IHD), during wildfires have been inconclusive. Methods and Results-—We examined the associations of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, IHD, acute myocardial infarction, and angina (hospital admissions and emergency department attendance) with PM2.5 concentrations during the 2006–2007 wildfires in Victoria, Australia, using a time-stratified case-crossover study design. Health data were obtained from comprehensive healthbased administrative registries for the study period (December 2006 to January 2007). Modeled and validated air exposure data from wildfire smoke emissions (daily average PM2.5, temperature, relative humidity) were also estimated for this period. There were 457 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, 2106 emergency department visits, and 3274 hospital admissions for IHD. After adjusting for temperature and relative humidity, an increase in interquartile range of 9.04 lg/m3 in PM2.5 over 2 days moving average (lag 0-1) was associated with a 6.98\% (95\% CI 1.03\% to 13.29\%) increase in risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, with strong association shown by men (9.05\%,95\%CI 1.63\% to 17.02\%) and by older adults (aged ≥65 years) (7.25\%, 95\% CI 0.24\% to 14.75\%). Increase in risk was (2.07\%, 95\% CI 0.09\% to 4.09\%) for IHD-related emergency department attendance and (1.86\%, 95\% CI: 0.35\% to 3.4\%) for IHD-related hospital admissions at lag 2 days, with strong associations shown by women (3.21\%, 95\% CI 0.81\% to 5.67\%) and by older adults (2.41\%, 95\% CI 0.82\% to 5.67\%). Conclusion-—PM2.5 exposure was associated with increased risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and IHD during the 2006–2007 wildfires in Victoria. This evidence indicates that PM2.5 may act as a triggering factor for acute coronary events during wildfire episodes. ( J Am Heart Assoc. 2015;4:e001653 doi: 10.1161/JAHA.114.001653)},

These samples were analyzed using synchrotron X-ray fluorescence for 3-h average concentrations of 19 elements consisting of S, Si, Al, Fe, Ca, Cl, Cu, Zn, Ti, K, Mn, Pb, Ni, V, Se, As, Rb, Cr, Br. The size-resolved data sets were then analyzed using the positive matrix factorization (PMF) technique in order to identify possible sources and estimate their contribution to particulate matter mass. PMF analysis uses the uncertainty of the measured data to provide an optimal weighting. Fifteen sources were resolved in eight size ranges (0.07∼12 µm) and included continental soil, local soil, sea salt, biomass/biofuel burning, coal combustion, oil heating furnace, residual oil fired boiler, municipal incineration, nonferrous metal source, ferrous metal source, gasoline vehicle, diesel vehicle, copper smelter and volcanic emission. PMF analysis of size-resolved source contributions showed that natural sources represented by local soil, sea salt and continental soil contributed about 79\% to the predicted primary particulate matter (PM) mass in the coarse size range (1.15∼12 µm). On the other hand, anthropogenic sources such as coal combustion and biomass/biofuel burning contributed about 60\% in the fine size range (0.56∼2.5 µm). The diesel vehicle source contributed the most in the ultra-fine size range (0.07∼0.56 µm) and was responsible for about 52\% of the primary PM mass.},

  abstract = {The concentration of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) measured in an industrial area is strongly influenced by the industrial characteristics of the region. Ulsan, an industrial city in Korea, has a large regional impact on PM2.5 concentration because various industries, such as the petrochemical, automobile manufacturing, and shipbuilding, are located in this city. As such, the PM2.5 pollution sources must be identified to enable its management. In this study, PM2.5 source apportionment was conducted in Ulsan. In this process, the contribution to secondary organic formation was estimated considering the secondary organic carbon (SOC) calculated using the elemental carbon (EC) tracer method. Sources were classified into ten categories (i.e., coal-related, industry, sea salt, secondary sulfate, soil, oil combustion, secondary nitrate, trafficrelated, SOC formation, and primary emission). Of these, secondary formation contributed approximately 71\%. The high rate of secondary production seems to be influenced by the industry in the area. Contributions of secondary sulfate and secondary nitrate were related to the seasons, contributing to the most, in summer and winter, respectively. SOC formation was highest in spring, not summer, which seems to be due to the decrease in organic carbon (OC) concentration due to the washing effect of summer. The contribution of secondary formation in Ulsan was likely overestimated due to the influence of local sources. The positive matrix factorization (PMF) with SOC performed in this study can help to easily separate the PM2.5 sources of secondary formation and primary emissions.},

This review summarizes the current knowledge of a new potential etiology of the disease, with a special focus on hemoglobin-induced oxidative stress. Furthermore, we also suggest hemoglobin as a potential target for therapy. Gene and protein profiling studies have shown increased expression and accumulation of free fetal hemoglobin in the preeclamptic placenta. Predominantly due to oxidative damage to the placental barrier, fetal hemoglobin leaks over to the maternal circulation. Free hemoglobin and its metabolites are toxic in several ways; (a) ferrous hemoglobin (Fe2+) binds strongly to the vasodilator nitric oxide (NO) and reduces the availability of free NO, which results in vasoconstriction, (b) hemoglobin (Fe2+) with bound oxygen spontaneously generates free oxygen radicals, and (c) the heme groups create an inflammatory response by inducing activation of neutrophils and cytokine production. The endogenous protein α1-microglobulin, with radical and heme binding properties, has shown both ex vivo and in vivo to have the ability to counteract free hemoglobin-induced placental and kidney damage. Oxidative stress in general, and more specifically fetal hemoglobin-induced oxidative stress, could play a key role in the pathology of preeclampsia seen both in the placenta and ultimately in the maternal endothelium.},

  abstract = {27 Biomass burning (BB) affects air quality, the global cycling of carbon, climate, and 28 human health. Intensive BB activities occur throughout the year due to wildfires and domestic 29 wood burning in Fairbanks. We collected total suspended particle samples from the air in 30 Fairbanks from June 2008 to June 2009. Here, we report seasonal variations in the molecular 31 composition of organic aerosols and its BB contributions in Fairbanks. Levoglucosan is the 32 dominant BB tracer (annual mean 67 ± 77 ng m-3), showing a winter maximum (145 ± 47 ng m-33 3) and spring minimum (12 ± 12 ng m-3). Levoglucosan showed significant correlations 34 (p{$<$}0.001) with organic carbon (OC), water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) and PM 2.5 , 35 indicating a significant contribution of BB to hazes in Fairbanks. However, no correlation exists 36 between levoglucosan and non-sea salt potassium (nss-K +), which has been proposed as a BB 37 tracer. We hypothesize that nss-K + is removed by deposition on the inner surfaces of woodstove 38 chimneys. Levoglucosan contributes 3.6\% to OC and 6.3\% to WSOC in winter, indicating that 39 BB significantly affects carbonaceous aerosols in central Alaska. Moreover, positive matrix 40 factorization analysis demonstrates that BB is an important source (47.5\%) of Fairbanks year-41 round aerosols. We conclude that domestic wood burning is an important source of atmospheric 42 particles that impact the air quality of Fairbanks, especially in winter. We presumed that 43 Fairbanks BB products might be transported to the remote Arctic, potentially affecting the 44 chemical composition of Arctic aerosols. These findings will be useful to better understand the 45 seasonal influence of BB on the Arctic and subarctic aerosols. 46 47 Keywords: Domestic wood burning, anhydrosugars, lignin and resin acids, seasonal variation, 48 potassium, woodstove 49 3},

  abstract = {Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) with a higher oxidative potential has been thought to be more detrimental to pulmonary health. We aim to investigate the associations between personal exposure to PM2.5 oxidative potential and pulmonary outcomes in asthmatic children. We measured each of the 43 asthmatic children 4 times for airway mechanics, lung function, airway inflammation, and asthma symptom scores. Coupling measured indoor and outdoor concentrations of PM2.5 mass, constituents, and oxidative potential with individual time−activity data, we calculated 24 h average personal exposures 0−3 days prior to a health outcome measurement. We found that increases in daily personal exposure to PM2.5 oxidative potential were significantly associated with increased small, large, and total airway resistance, increased airway impedance, decreased lung function, and worsened scores of individual asthma symptoms and the total symptom score. Among the PM2.5 constituents, organic matters largely of indoor origin contributed the greatest to PM2.5 oxidative potential. Given that the variability in PM2.5 oxidative potential was a stronger driver than PM2.5 mass for the variability in the respiratory health outcomes, it is suggested to reduce PM2.5 oxidative potential, particularly by reducing the organic matter constituent of indoor PM2.5, as a targeted source control strategy in asthma management.},

  abstract = {It has been widely accepted that the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is an important pathophysiologic pathway linking particulate matter (PM) exposure and adverse health effects. ROS can be either present on and/or within PM or generated in vivo by the interactions between PM and biological systems. Within the context of toxicology, PM oxidative potential (OP) is the capacity of PM to oxidize molecules in biological tissues or cells directly by oxidants that are present on and/or within PM and indirectly by the ROS generated via PM interactions with the biological system (e.g., fluids, cells, and tissues). In this review, we summarized the current PM OP measurement methods, current understanding of how PM physical characteristics and chemical compositions affect OP, and the epidemiological and toxicological evidence on whether PM OP is a better indicator than PM mass concentration for health effects. Among the two major types of OP measurement methods, cellular assays have been regarded to better reflect the actions of PM in a biological system than acellular assays. Recent epidemiological studies have associated short-term PM OP exposure with adverse cardiorespiratory health outcomes. Little is known about the health effects of long-term PM OP exposure and on the effect beyond the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. The existing evidence may be sufficient to suggest the use of PM OP as a more health-relevant exposure metric than conventional PM mass concentration, but critical methodologic issues must be resolved before this metric can be widely and accurately used.},

  abstract = {Sampling of particles (PM10) was conducted during a one-year period at two rural sites in Central Chile, Quillota and Linares. The samples were analyzed for elemental composition. The data sets have undergone source–receptor analyses in order to estimate the sources and their abundance’s in the PM10 size fraction, by using the factor analytical methodpositive matrix factorization (PMF). The analysis showedthat PM10 was dominatedby soil resuspension at both sites during the summer months, while during winter traffic dominated the particle mass at Quillota and local woodburning dominatedthe particle mass at Linares. Two copper smelters impactedthe Quillota station, and contributedto 10\% and16\% of PM10 as an average during summer andwinter, respectively. One smelter impacted Linares by 8\% and19\% of PM10 in the summer andwinter, respectively. For arsenic the two smelters accountedfor 87\% of the monitoredarsenic levels at Quillota andat Linares one smelter contributed with 72\% of the measured mass. In comparison with PMF, the use of a dispersion model tended to overestimate the smelter contribution to arsenic levels at both sites. The robustness of the PMF model was tested by using randomly reduced data sets, where 85\%, 70\%, 50\% and 33\% of the samples were included. In this way the ability of the model to reconstruct the sources initially found by the original data set could be tested. On average for all sources the relative standard deviation increased from 7\% to 25\% for the variables identifying the sources, when decreasing the data set from 85\% to 33\% of the samples, indicating that the solution initially foundwas very stable to begin with. But it was also notedthat sources due to industrial or combustion processes were more sensitive for the size of the data set, comparedto the natural sources as local soil andsea spray sources. r 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Abstract. The Station for Measuring Ecosystem–Atmosphere Relations (SMEAR) II, located within the boreal forest of Finland, is a unique station in the world due to the wide range of long-term measurements tracking the Earth–atmosphere interface. In this study, we characterize the composition of organic aerosol (OA) at SMEAR II by quantifying its driving constituents. We utilize a multi-year data set of OA mass spectra measured in situ with an Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM) at the station. To our knowledge, this mass spectral time series is the longest of its kind published to date. Similarly to other previously reported efforts in OA source apportionment from multi-seasonal or multi-annual data sets, we approached the OA characterization challenge through positive matrix factorization (PMF) using a rolling window approach. However, the existing methods for extracting minor OA components were found to be insufficient for our rather remote site. To overcome this issue, we tested a new statistical analysis framework. This included unsupervised feature extraction and classification stages to explore a large number of unconstrained PMF runs conducted on the measured OA mass spectra. Anchored by these results, we finally constructed a relaxed chemical mass balance (CMB) run that resolved different OA components from our observations. The presented combination of statistical tools provided a data-driven analysis methodology, which in our case achieved robust solutions with minimal subjectivity. Following the extensive statistical analyses, we were able to divide the 2012–2019 SMEAR II OA data (mass concentration interquartile range (IQR): 0.7, 1.3, and 2.6\,µg\,m−3) into three sub-categories – low-volatility oxygenated OA (LV-OOA), semi-volatile oxygenated OA (SV-OOA), and primary OA (POA) – proving that the tested methodology was able to provide results consistent with literature. LV-OOA was the most dominant OA type (organic mass fraction IQR: 49\,\%, 62\,\%, and 73\,\%). The seasonal cycle of LV-OOA was bimodal, with peaks both in summer and in February. We associated the wintertime LV-OOA with anthropogenic sources and assumed biogenic influence in LV-OOA formation in summer. Through a brief trajectory analysis, we estimated summertime natural LV-OOA formation of tens of ng\,m−3\,h−1 over the boreal forest. SV-OOA was the second highest contributor to OA mass (organic mass fraction IQR: 19\,\%, 31\,\%, and 43\,\%). Due to SV-OOA's clear peak in summer, we estimate biogenic processes as the main drivers in its formation. Unlike for LV-OOA, the highest SV-OOA concentrations were detected in stable summertime nocturnal surface layers. Two nearby sawmills also played a significant role in SV-OOA production as also exemplified by previous studies at SMEAR II. POA, taken as a mix of two different OA types reported previously, hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA) and biomass burning OA (BBOA), made up a minimal OA mass fraction (IQR: 2\,\%, 6\,\%, and 13\,\%). Notably, the quantification of POA at SMEAR II using ACSM data was not possible following existing rolling PMF methodologies. Both POA organic mass fraction and mass concentration peaked in winter. Its appearance at SMEAR II was linked to strong southerly winds. Similar wind direction and speed dependence was not observed among other OA types. The high wind speeds probably enabled the POA transport to SMEAR II from faraway sources in a relatively fresh state. In the event of slower wind speeds, POA likely evaporated and/or aged into oxidized organic aerosol before detection. The POA organic mass fraction was significantly lower than reported by aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) measurements 2~to 4~years prior to the ACSM measurements. While the co-located long-term measurements of black carbon supported the hypothesis of higher POA loadings prior to year 2012, it is also possible that short-term (POA) pollution plumes were averaged out due to the slow time resolution of the ACSM combined with the further 3\,h data averaging needed to ensure good signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Despite the length of the ACSM data set, we did not focus on quantifying long-term trends of POA (nor other components) due to the high sensitivity of OA composition to meteorological anomalies, the occurrence of which is likely not normally distributed over the 8-year measurement period. Due to the unique and realistic seasonal cycles and meteorology dependences of the independent OA subtypes complemented by the reasonably low degree of unexplained OA variability, we believe that the presented data analysis approach performs well. Therefore, we hope that these results encourage also other researchers possessing several-year-long time series of similar data to tackle the data analysis via similar semi- or unsupervised machine-learning approaches. This way the presented method could be further optimized and its usability explored and evaluated also in other environments.},

Incorrect self-reported emissions can severely impact on air quality models and regulatory decisions. We compared self-reported emissions of organic gases in Houston, Texas, to measurements at a receptor site near the Houston ship channel, a major petrochemical complex. We analyzed hourly observations of total nonmethane organic carbon and 54 hydrocarbon compounds from C-2 to C-9 for the period June through November, 1993. We were able to demonstrate severe inconsistencies between reported emissions and major sources as derived from the data using a multivariate receptor model. The composition and the location of the sources as deduced from the data are not consistent with the reported industrial emissions. On the other hand, our observationally based methods did correctly identify the location and composition of a relatively small nearby chemical plant. This paper provides strong empirical evidence that regulatory agencies and photochemical models are making predictions based on inaccurate industrial emissions.},

  abstract = {Four hundred fine particulate matter (PM2.5) samples collected over a 1-year period at two sites in the Los Angeles Basin were analyzed for organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), water soluble organic carbon (WSOC) and organic molecular markers. The results were used in a Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) receptor model to obtain daily, monthly and annual average source contributions to PM2.5 OC. Results of the PMF model showed similar source categories with comparable year-long contributions to PM2.5 OC across the sites. Five source categories providing reasonably stable profiles were identified: mobile, wood smoke, primary biogenic, and two types of secondary organic carbon (SOC) (i.e., anthropogenic and biogenic emissions). Total primary emission factors and total SOC factors contributed approximately 60\% and 40\%, respectively, to the annual-average OC concentrations. Primary sources showed strong seasonal patterns with high winter peaks and low summer peaks, while SOC showed a reverse pattern with highs in the spring and summer in the region. Interestingly, smoke from forest fires which occurred episodically in California during the summer and fall of 2009 was identified and combined with the primary biogenic source as one distinct factor to the OC budget. The PMF resolved factors were further investigated and compared to a chemical mass balance (CMB) model and a second multi-variant receptor model (UNMIX) using molecular markers considered in the PMF. Good agreement between the source contribution from mobile sources and biomass burning for three models were obtained, providing additional weight of evidence that these source apportionment techniques are sufficiently accurate for policy development. However, the CMB model did not quantify primary biogenic emissions, which were included in other sources with the SOC. Both multivariate receptor models, the PMF and the UNMIX, were unable to separate source contributions from diesel and gasoline engines. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Much less attention was paid to emissions from domestic wood combustion though the importance of residential wood burning as a source of atmospheric particulate matter (PM) in the Alpine region has been shown in many studies.Here we review the current knowledge about the contribution of wood burning emissions to ambient concentrations of elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC) and PM in the Alpine region. The published results obtained by different approaches (e.g. macro-tracer method, multivariate receptor modeling, chemical mass balance modelling, and so-called Aethalometer modeling) are used in an ambient mono-tracer approach to estimate representative relationships between wood burning tracers (levoglucosan and mannosan) and EC, OC and PM from wood burning. The relationships found are applied to available ambient measurements of levoglucosan and mannosan at Alpine sites for estimation of the contributions of wood burning emissions to average levels of carbonaceous aerosols and PM at these sites. Our results imply that PM from wood burning alone adds often up to 50\% and more of the EU daily limit value for PM10 in several alpine valleys during days in winter. Concentrations of carbonaceous aerosols in these valleys are often up to six times higher than in urban or rural sites at the foothills of the Alps. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this work, a multi-site PM10 sampling campaign was performed in seven sites located in the southern part of the Santander Bay (northern Spain), an urban area characterized by the proximity of some metal(loid) industrial sources (mainly a manganese alloy plant). The total content of V, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Mo, Cd, Sb and Pb was determined by ICP-MS. This multi-site dataset was evaluated by positive matrix factorization (PMF) in order to identify the main anthropogenic metal(loid) sources impacting the studied area, and to quantify their contribution to the measured metal(loid) levels. The attribution of the sources was done by comparing the factor profiles obtained by the PMF analysis with representative profiles from known metal(loid) sources in the area, included in both the European database SPECIEUROPE (V2.0) and the US database EPA-SPECIATE (V4.5) or calculated from literature data. In addition, conditional bivariate probability functions (CBPF)s were used to assist in the identification of the sources. Four metal(loid) sources were identified: Fugitive and point source emissions from the manganese alloy plant (49.9\% and 9.9\%, respectively), non-exhaust traffic emissions (38.3\%) and a minor source of mixed origin (1.8\%). The PMF analysis was able to make a clear separation between two different sources from the manganese alloy plant, which represented almost 60\% of the total measured metal(loid) levels, {$>$}80\% of these emissions being assigned to fugitive emissions. These results will be useful for the assessment of the health risk associated with PM10-bound metal(loid) exposure and for the design of efficient abatement strategies in areas impacted by similar industries.},

These species are often rare and have limited known occurrences, posing challenges for creating accurate species distribution models. We tested four modeling methods (Bioclim, Domain, GARP, and Maxent) across 18 species with different levels of ecological specialization using six different sample size treatments and three different evaluation measures. Our assessment revealed that Maxent was the most capable of the four modeling methods in producing useful results with sample sizes as small as 5, 10 and 25 occurrences. The other methods compensated reasonably well (Domain and GARP) to poorly (Bioclim) when presented with datasets of small sample sizes. We show that multiple evaluation measures are necessary to determine accuracy of models produced with presence-only data. Further, we found that accuracy of models is greater for species with small geographic ranges and limited environmental tolerance, ecological characteristics of many rare species. Our results indicate that reasonable models can be made for some rare species, a result that should encourage conservationists to add distribution modeling to their toolbox. © Ecography.}

  abstract = {Significant attention, especially in the last decade, has been focussed on elevated concentrations of ultrafine particulate matter (UFP) in urban areas and the adverse health effects associated with exposure to UFP. Despite this, there is a relative scarcity of long-term ambient UFP measurements. This study examined trends in UFP measurements made continuously near a busy roadway in downtown Toronto, Canada, between the years 2006 and 2019 using a fast mobility particle sizer (FMPS). These long-term trends were associated with other air pollutant concentrations—namely: nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and fine particulate matter mass concentrations (PM2.5)—and persistent declining trends were observed for each during the study period. From 2006 to 2019, reductions of 45\%, 68\%, 39\%, 83\%, and 41\%, for UFP, NO, NO2, SO2, and PM2.5, respectively, were observed. These reductions are in part associated with a total phase-out of coal-fired electricity generation in Ontario, Canada, between 2004 and 2015, and continuous improvements in vehicle emissions control technologies. Additionally, deconvolution of the time-series yielded seasonal fluctuations which were analysed as a function of particle diameter and ambient temperature, the results from which may aid in the comparison of UFP measurements made in climates with different ambient temperature ranges in a meaningful way. Finally, the UFP data were background-subtracted and it was found that local sources (such as vehicle traffic) contributed 45\% to total concentrations and this fraction remained relatively constant throughout the study. A multilinear function regressed on these local and background concentrations better elucidated the sources contributing to UFP variability—background concentrations were largely covariate with SO2 emissions whereas local concentrations were more affected by NO emissions. The data in this study shows clear co-benefits to reducing UFP concentrations by targeting NOx and SOx emissions.},

From the isolated HULIS, aerosol particles were generated and their scattering and absorption coefficients measured. The size distribution and mass of the particles were also recorded. The value of the index of refraction was derived from “closure” calculations based on particle size, scattering and absorption measurements. On average, the complex index of refraction at 532 nm of HULIS collected during day and nighttime was 1.65–0.0019i and 1.69–0.0016i, respectively. In addition, the imaginary part of the complex index of refraction was calculated using the measured absorption coefficient of the bulk HULIS.},

  abstract = {Efforts have been made to relate measured concentrations of airborne constituents to their origins for more than 50 years. During this time interval, there have been developments in the measurement technology to gather highly time-resolved, detailed chemical compositional data. Similarly, the improvements in computers have permitted a parallel development of data analysis tools that permit the extraction of information from these data. There is now a substantial capability to provide useful insights into the sources of pollutants and their atmospheric processing that can help inform air quality management options. Efforts have been made to combine receptor and chemical transport models to provide improved apportionments. Tools are available to utilize limited numbers of known profiles with the ambient data to obtain more accurate apportionments for targeted sources. In addition, tools are in place to allow more advanced models to be fitted to the data based on conceptual models of the nature of the sources and the sampling/analytical approach. Each of the approaches has its strengths and weaknesses. However, the field as a whole suffers from a lack of measurements of source emission compositions. There has not been an active effort to develop source profiles for stationary sources for a long time, and with many significant sources built in developing countries, the lack of local profiles is a serious problem in effective source apportionment. The field is now relatively mature in terms of its methods and its ability to adapt to new measurement technologies, so that we can be assured of a high likelihood of extracting the maximal information from the collected data. Implications: Efforts have been made over the past 50 years to use air quality data to estimate the influence of air pollution sources. These methods are now relatively mature and many are readily accessible through publically available software. This review examines the development of receptor models and the current state of the art in extracting source identification and apportionments from ambient air quality data.},

However, self-modeling curve resolution of spectrochemical data is often able to achieve good separations given fixed spectral characteristics including true zero absorbance values and typically smaller measurement uncertainties. For air pollution mixture problems such as the identification and quantification of sources of ambient particulate matter (PM), there are problems of the lack of true zero values in either the source profiles or their contributions to the ambient concentrations, variability in the source profiles, and typically much larger measurement uncertainties. Recent work has provided several approaches to reducing rotational ambiguity and providing improved resolution including preprocessing the data to remove the meteorologically induced covariance, applying constraints based on a priori knowledge, and analysis of multiple site data. Examples of these applications to airborne PM have shown improved results.},

  abstract = {The major inorganic constituents and organic tracer compounds in PM               2.5               were used in positive matrix factorization (PMF) and chemical mass balance (CMB) models to apportion the primary and secondary source contributions to organic carbon (OC) in Hong Kong during the summer of 2006. Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) tracers of several biogenic and anthropogenic hydrocarbons were included in the PMF analysis. Their inclusion allowed the identification of two components of SOA among seven factors resolved by PMF. One SOA component was mainly associated with secondary sulfate and nitrate. The other SOA component, characterized by biogenic SOA tracers and mixed with biomass burning and vegetative detritus particles, was biomass burning‐induced SOA. Secondary OC (SOC) apportioned by PMF (SOC               PMF               ) was on average 6.84               μ               gC m               −3               (65\% of PM               2.5               OC) on high pollution days under influence of significant regional transport (i.e., regional days) and 0.70               μ               gC m               −3               (25\% of PM               2.5               OC) on days under the influence of mainly local emissions (i.e., local days). The biomass burning‐induced SOA accounted for 20\% of the total SOA on the regional days, underlining the importance of biomass burning aerosol source in this region. The average uncertainty for the SOC               PMF               estimates was ∼20\% on the regional days and ∼120\% on the local days. SOC               PMF               was compared with SOC determined by CMB (SOC               CMB               , i.e., unapportioned OC by CMB analysis) and a tracer‐based method (SOC               TBM               ) that apportioned SOC contributions by four hydrocarbon precursors including isoprene, monoterpenes,               β               ‐caryophyllene, and toluene. The three estimates of SOC closely tracked with each other among individual samples. The SOC               CMB               and SOC               PMF               estimates on the majority of the regional days differed from each other by less than 25\%. Good correlations between contributions of SOC and individual primary OC sources apportioned by PMF and CMB further added to the credence to the PMF‐derived estimation of secondary and primary OC source contributions by using secondary and primary aerosol organic tracers as the fitting species.},

  abstract = {Source apportionment studies of particulate matter (PM) link chemical composition to emission sources, while health risk analyses link health outcomes and chemical composition. There are limited studies to link emission sources and health risks from ambient measurements. We show such an attempt for particulate trace elements. Elements in PM2.5 were measured in wintertime Beijing, and the total concentrations of 14 trace elements were 1.3-7.3 times higher during severe pollution days than during low pollution days. Fe, Zn, and Pb were the most abundant elements independent of the PM pollution levels. Chemical fractionation shows that Pb, Mn, Cd, As, Sr, Co, V, Cu, and Ni were present mainly in the bioavailable fraction. Positive matrix factorization was used to resolve the sources of particulate trace elements into dust, oil combustion, coal combustion, and traffic-related emissions. Traffic-related emission contributed 65\% of total mass of the measured elements during low pollution days. However, coal combustion dominated (58\%) during severe pollution days. By combining element-specific health risk analyses and source apportionment results, we conclude that traffic-related emission dominates the health risks by particulate trace elements during low pollution days, while coal combustion becomes equally or even more important during moderate and severe pollution days.}

Therefore, this study aimed to reveal the characteristics and health effects of the PM2.5 in the subway system. The PM2.5 samples were collected from ticket counters, platforms, and carriages in the overground and underground subway systems in Chengdu, and the composition of PM2.5 at different sites was detected. The pollution degree of toxic elements in PM2.5 and the health risks were evaluated. The results showed that the concentrations of PM2.5, some elements (e.g., arsenic, barium, chromium, copper, iron, manganese, nickel, and antimony), and total carbon at the underground sites were higher than those at the corresponding overground sites, respectively. The pollution extent at underground sites was more severe than that at overground sites according to pollution load index. The subway workers had potential non-carcinogenic risks. The total cancer risks for subway workers were at a moderate level, and for passengers were at a low level in most conditions. The contributions of arsenic to the hazard index and total cancer risk were 74.22\%–81.5\% and 79.4\%–85.3\%, respectively. Overall, underground platforms and carriages were the locations with the highest health risks for subway workers and passengers respectively. Subway workers faced higher health risks than passengers and arsenic was identified as the predominant risk element. These results provide basic data for future subway air quality improvement.},

  abstract = {The equation of Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) has been modified to resolve multiple time resolution inputs and applied in numerous field studies. The refined modeling results provide a solution with an increased number of factors and enriched profile features. However, the incorporation of low time-resolved data may retrieve unfavorable mixed factor profiles, introducing high uncertainties into the PMF solution computations. To address this issue, a dual-stage PMF modeling procedure with predefined constraints was proposed. Multiple time-resolved PM2.5 inorganic and organic speciation measurements were collected from autumn of 2022 to summer of 2023 in Taipei, Taiwan. Without using the proposed approach, a mixed factor of vehicle/biomass burning and an unphysically meaningful factor of sodium ion- and ammonium ion-rich were identified. After implementing the proposed approach, a refined number of eight factors with separated and reasonable profiles were retrieved. Over the sampling period, the largest contributor to PM2.5 and organic carbon was vehicle (contribution = 26\% and 47\%, respectively), while those for secondary inorganic aerosols of SO42−, NO3−, and NH4+ were industry (27\%, 25\%, and 31\%, respectively), highlighting the importance of regulating these two sources. The low vehicle contribution to NO3− may be due to time-lag effects from gas-to-particle conversion, which led to different temporal patterns between NO3− and primary species. Addressing this issue is crucial in future studies for better apportionment of secondary aerosols.},

  abstract = {Context Associations have been found between day-to-day particulate air pollution and increased risk of various adverse health outcomes, including cardiopulmonary mortality. However, studies of health effects of long-term particulate air pollution have been less conclusive. Objective To assess the relationship between long-term exposure to fine particulate air pollution and all-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants Vital status and cause of death data were collected by the American Cancer Society as part of the Cancer Prevention II study, an ongoing prospective mortality study, which enrolled approximately 1.2 million adults in 1982. Participants completed a questionnaire detailing individual risk factor data (age, sex, race, weight, height, smoking history, education, marital status, diet, alcohol consumption, and occupational exposures). The risk factor data for approximately 500 000 adults were linked with air pollution data for metropolitan areas throughout the United States and combined with vital status and cause of death data through December 31, 1998. Main Outcome Measure All-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality. Results Fine particulate and sulfur oxide–related pollution were associated with all-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality. Each 10-µg/m3 elevation in fine particulate air pollution was associated with approximately a 4\%, 6\%, and 8\% increased risk of all-cause, cardiopulmonary, and lung cancer mortality, respectively. Measures of coarse particle fraction and total suspended particles were not consistently associated with mortality. Conclusion Long-term exposure to combustion-related fine particulate air pollution is an important environmental risk factor for cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality. Based on several severe air pollution events,1- 3 a temporal correlation between extremely high concentrations of particulate and sulfur oxide air pollution and acute increases in mortality was well established by the 1970s. Subsequently, epidemiological studies published between 1989 and 1996 reported health effects at unexpectedly low concentrations of particulate air pollution.4 The convergence of data from these studies, while controversial,5 prompted serious reconsideration of standards and health guidelines6- 10 and led to a long-term research program designed to analyze health-related effects due to particulate pollution.11- 13 In 1997, the Environmental Protection Agency adopted new ambient air quality standards that would impose regulatory limits on fine particles measuring less than 2.5 µm in diameter (PM2.5). These new standards were challenged by industry groups, blocked by a federal appeals court, but ultimately upheld by the US Supreme Court.14 Although most of the recent epidemiological research has focused on effects of short-term exposures, several studies suggest that long-term exposure may be more important in terms of overall public health.4 The new standards for long-term exposure to PM2.5 were originally based primarily on 2 prospective cohort studies,15,16 which evaluated the effects of long-term pollution exposure on mortality. Both of these studies have been subjected to much scrutiny,5 including an extensive independent audit and reanalysis of the original data.17 The larger of these 2 studies linked individual risk factor and vital status data with national ambient air pollution data.16 Our analysis uses data from the larger study and (1) doubles the follow-up time to more than 16 years and triples the number of deaths; (2) substantially expands exposure data, including gaseous copollutant data and new PM2.5 data, which have been collected since the promulgation of the new air quality standards; (3) improves control of occupational exposures; (4) incorporates dietary variables that account for total fat consumption, and consumption of vegetables, citrus, and high-fiber grains; and (5) uses recent advances in statistical modeling, including the incorporation of random effects and nonparametric spatial smoothing components in the Cox proportional hazards model.},

  abstract = {Here, we discuss the influences of small-scale biomass burning (BB) originating from local/regional emissions, such as agricultural waste burning, which are difficult to detect via remote sensing. To evaluate the BB contribution, we used a positive matrix factorization (PMF) model with chemical component data including levoglucosan, a useful BB indicator, at multiple urban, suburban, and background sites in central Japan during two weeks in October and November of 2014 and January and February of 2015. High levoglucosan concentrations were observed not only at the suburban sites but also at the urban sites. At the background site located downwind of Northeast China, the levoglucosan concentrations were elevated when air masses were transported from Northeast China, where fire spots were detected. Meanwhile, at the other sites, small-scale local or regional BB emissions prevailed, and fire spots were rarely detected. At these sites, the levoglucosan levels were high although the relevant air masses did not originate in Northeast China. The source apportionment results demonstrated that in fall, BB was a significant source of particulate matter with diameters of less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5), organic carbon, and elemental carbon at all sites. Notably, the BB contributions to PM2.5 were higher at an urban site located near farmland than at other urban sites in fall and winter. Our results indicate that specific BB emission sources, such as local, small, and irregular open field burning, impact the air quality not only at suburban areas but also at urban areas in central Japan.},

The results were compared with previous estimates generated using the positive matrix factorization (PMF) receptor model to investigate each model’s source-apportioning capability. All models used the PM10 chemical composition (organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), water soluble inorganic ions (WSIC), and trace elements) for source apportionment. The average PM10 concentration during the study period was 249.7 ± 103.9 g/m3 (range: 61.4–584.8 g/m3). The UNMIX model resolved five sources (soil dust (SD), vehicular emissions (VE), secondary aerosols (SA), a mixed source of biomass burning (BB) and sea salt (SS), and industrial emissions (IE)). The PCA/APCS model also resolved five sources, two of which also included mixed sources (SD, VE, SD+SS, (SA+BB+SS) and IE). The PMF analysis differentiated seven individual sources (SD, VE, SA, BB, SS, IE, and fossil fuel combustion (FFC)). All models identified the main sources contributing to PM10 emissions and reconfirmed that VE, SA, BB, and SD were the dominant contributors in Delhi.},

  abstract = {The present study attempts to explore and compare the seasonal variability in chemical composition and contributions of different sources of fine and coarse fractions of aerosols (PM2.5 and PM10) in Delhi, India from January 2013 to December 2016. The annual average concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 were 131 ± 79 mg m3 (range: 17e417 mg m3) and 238 ± 106 mg m3 (range: 34e537 mg m3), respectively. PM2.5 and PM10 samples were chemically characterized to assess their chemical components [i.e. organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), water soluble inorganic ionic components (WSICs) and heavy and trace elements] and then used for estimation of enrichment factors (EFs) and applied positive matrix factorization (PMF5) model to evaluate their prominent sources on seasonal basis in Delhi. PMF identified eight major sources i.e. Secondary nitrate (SN), secondary sulphate (SS), vehicular emissions (VE), biomass burning (BB), soil dust (SD), fossil fuel combustion (FFC), sodium and magnesium salts (SMS) and industrial emissions (IE). Total carbon contributes \textasciitilde 28\% to the total PM2.5 concentration and 24\% to the total PM10 concentration and followed the similar seasonality pattern. SN and SS followed opposite seasonal pattern, where SN was higher during colder seasons while SS was greater during warm seasons. The seasonal differences in VE contributions were not very striking as it prevails evidently most of year. Emissions from BB is one of the major sources in Delhi with larger contribution during winter and post monsoon seasons due to stable meteorological conditions and aggrandized biomass burning (agriculture residue burning in and around the regions; mainly Punjab and Haryana) and domestic heating during the season. Conditional Bivariate Probability Function (CBPF) plots revealed that the maximum concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 were carried by north westerly winds (north-western Indo Gangetic Plains of India).},

  abstract = {Background: The oxidative potential (OP) of particulate matter (PM) has been proposed as a more health relevant metric than PM mass. Different assays exist for measuring OP and little is known about how the different assays compare. Aim: To assess the OP of PM collected at different site types and to evaluate differences between locations, size fractions and correlation with PM mass and PM composition for different measurement methods for OP. Methods: PM2.5 and PM10 was sampled at 5 sites: an underground station, a farm, 2 traffic sites and an urban background site. Three a-cellular assays; dithiothreitol (OPDTT), electron spin resonance (OPESR) and ascorbate depletion (OPAA) were used to characterize the OP of PM. Results: The highest OP was observed at the underground, where OP of PM10 was 30 (OPDTT) to {$>$}600 (OPESR) times higher compared to the urban background when expressed as OP/m3 and 2-40 times when expressed as OP/μg. For the outdoor sites, samples from the farm showed significantly lower OPESR and OPAA, whereas samples from the continuous traffic site showed the highest OP for all assays. Contrasts in OP between sites were generally larger than for PM mass and were lower for OPDTT compared to OPESR and OPAA. Furthermore, OPDTT/μg was significantly higher in PM2.5 compared to PM10, whereas the reverse was the case for OPESR. OPESR and OPAA were highly correlated with traffic-related PM components (i.e. EC, Fe, Cu, PAHs), whereas OPDTT showed the highest correlation with PM mass and OC. Conclusions: Contrasts in OP between sites, differences in size fractions and correlation with PM composition depended on the specific OP assay used, with OPESR and OPAA showing the most similar results. This suggests that either OPESR or OPAA and OPDTT can complement each other in providing information regarding the oxidative properties of PM, which can subsequently be used to study its health effects. © 2013 The Authors.},

The composition data were applied to mass closure analysis and Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model along with detailed wind direction analysis for quantifying and identifying the probable sources of both PM size fractions. The average concentrations of PM2.5 (40 μg m 3) and PM10 (146 μg m 3) were greatly exceeded the WHO air quality thresholds for 78–92\% of the sampling days. Mass closure indicated the predominance of secondary inorganic aerosol (39\%) and EC (7\%) in fine PM, while mineral dust contributes 50\% to the total mass of coarse particles. PMF identified six major sources of fine and coarse PM, including secondary inorganic aerosols, vehicular emissions, heavy oil combustion, marine aerosols, mineral and fugitive dust. The wind direction analysis indicated that both local and regional sources impact Qatar’s air quality attributed to specific wind conditions. Two main sources of heavy oil combustion and secondary aerosols are closely related to regional emissions from shipping vessels and the petrochemical industry in the Gulf region. The desert dust transport mixed with local re-suspended dust and seasalt particles also contributes considerably to the local PM concentrations. The significant contributions of regional anthropogenic and natural emissions pose a significant challenge in meeting local PM standards, signifying the importance of regional collaboration for better control policies on reducing transboundary air pollution.},

Source apportionment of PM was performed using a receptor model, positive matrix factorization (PMF), to identify possible sources of PM and determine the influence of each identified source on local air quality. High concentrations of PM2.5 (o2.5 mm) were observed in winter months with an average of 18 mg m3, while the average concentration in summer months was approximately 6 mg m3. PMF apportioned the PM2.5 mass into seven factors identified as Na-rich, secondary sulfate, wood burning, wood processing, crustal material, traffic, and winter heating. The most important sources affecting ambient air quality in the deep valley rural area were wood burning and winter heating factors. In winter the wood burning and winter heating sources accounted for approximately 31\% and 43\% of the total PM2.5 mass, respectively, indicating the significant influence of biomass burning in the rural area. The wood burning and winter heating factors were highly associated with high organic carbon and volatile organic compounds. The identity of the sources was further elucidated by exploring their relationship with other measured parameters; a correlation study was conducted to evaluate relationships between the sources, gaseous pollutants, and meteorological variables.},

Three receptor models of principal component analysis/absolute principal component score (PCA/APCS), positive matrix factorization (PMF), and chemical mass balance (CMB) were used to apportion the source of PM2.5 obtained from the target city. The results of the receptor models indicated that the secondary formation of PM2.5 was the dominant (45–60\%) contributor to PM2.5 levels in the port city of Busan. The PMF and PCA/APCS suggested that ship emission was a non-negligible contributor of PM2.5 (up to about 10\%) in the study area, whereas it was a negligible contributor based on CMB. The magnitude of source contribution estimates to PM2.5 levels differed significantly among these three models due to their limitations (e.g., PM2.5 emission source profiles and restrictions of the models). Potential source contribution function and concentration-weighted trajectory analyses indicated that long-range transport from sources in the eastern China and Yellow Sea contributed significantly to the level of PM2.5 in Busan.},

  abstract = {Long-term trends (2004e2017) in the chemical composition and sources of PM2.5 (particulate matter smaller than 2.5 mm in diameter) in a metropolitan area were investigated using daily integrated PM2.5 chemical speciation data and continuous air pollution measurements. Eleven source factors were identified: coal combustion characterized by secondary sulphate, secondary nitrate, summertime organic carbon (OC), regional elemental carbon (EC), biomass burning, oil combustion, primary tailpipe emissions, non-tailpipe emissions related to road dust, non-tailpipe emissions related to brake wear, metal production, and road salt. Overall, coal combustion, secondary nitrate, regional EC, and oil combustion underwent marked decreases in concentrations with large reduction rates ranging from 8\% yr1 to 18\% yr1, contributing to an overall 34\% decrease in annual PM2.5 over the past 14 years. Decreases in local tailpipe emissions (3\% yr1) were consistent with the reduction of traffic-related air pollutants. In contrast, non-tailpipe emissions remained constant until 2010e2011 and then increased with a range of rates of 21\% yr1 to 27\% yr1 from 2011 to 2016. The contribution of summertime OC increased to approximately 27\% in the summer of 2013e2016, rising to become the largest PM2.5 source driven by the reduction of regional sources. The chemical composition of PM2.5 in the urban area drastically changed from inorganic-rich to organic- and metal-rich particles during 2013e2016. The depletion of ascorbic acid was measured using filter samples collected over one year to identify PM2.5 components and sources contributing to the oxidative potential (OP) of PM2.5. The OP was clearly associated with trace elements (e.g., Ba, Cu, Fe). Non-tailpipe emissions related to road dust and brake wear presented high redox activity per mass of PM2.5. This work suggests that summertime OC and non-tailpipe emissions in recent years have become increasingly important. As such, policies targeting traffic-related PM2.5 should focus on these sources for maximum impact.},

  abstract = {Oxidative potential (OP) has been proposed as a useful descriptor for the ability of particulate matter (PM) to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and consequently induce oxidative stress in biological systems, which has been recognized as one of the most important mechanisms responsible for PM toxicity. The dithiothreitol (DTT) assay is one of the most frequently used techniques to quantify OP because it is low-cost, easy-to-operate, and has high repeatability. With two thiol groups, DTT has been used as a surrogate of biological sulfurs that can be oxidized when exposed to ROS. Within the DTT measurement matrix, OP is defined as the DTT consumption rate. Often, the DTT consumption can be attributed to the presence of transition metals and quinones in PM as they can catalyze the oxidation of DTT through catalytic redox reactions. However, the DTT consumption by non-catalytic PM components has not been fully investigated. In addition, weak correlations between DTT consumption, ROS generation, and cellular responses have been observed in several studies, which also reveal the knowledge gaps between DTT-based OP measurements and their implication on health effects. In this review, we critically assessed the current challenges and limitations of DTT measurement, highlighted the understudied DTT consumption mechanisms, elaborated the necessity to understand both PM-bound and PM-induced ROS, and concluded with research needs to bridge the existing knowledge gaps.},

Taking an abandoned zinc smelter in southern China as an example, a total of 245 soil samples were collected to study spatial heterogeneity, source apportionment, and source-derived risk assessment of heavy metal(loid)s (HMs) in the region. The results showed that the mean values of all HMs concentrations were higher than the local background values, with Zn, Cd, Pb, and As contamination being the most serious and their plume penetrating to the bottom layer. Four sources were identified by principal component analysis and positive matrix factorization, with their contributions to the HMs contents ranked as: surface runoff (F2, 63.2\%) {$>$} surface solid waste (F1, 22.2\%) {$>$} atmospheric deposition (F3, 8.5\%) {$>$} parent material (F4, 6.1\%). Among these, F1 was a determinant source of human health risk with a contribution rate of 60\%. Therefore, F1 was considered to be the priority control factor, but it only accounted for 22.2\% of HMs contents contribution. Hg dominated the ecological risk with a contribution of 91.1\%. Pb (25.7\%) and As (32.9\%) accounted for the non-carcinogenic risk, while As (95\%) dominated the carcinogenic effect. The spatial characteristics of human health risk values derived from F1 indicated that high-risk areas were mainly distributed in the casting finished products area, electrolysis area, leaching-concentration area, and fluidization roasting area. The findings highlight the significance of priority control factors (including HMs, pollution sources and functional areas) for consideration in the integrated management of this region, thus saving costs for effective soil remediation.},

In small sample simulations, I show that using WLS-EV instead of OLS results in large efficiency gains, fewer false negatives, and avoids the bias associated with ex-post weighting schemes. Using WLS-EV also improves the out-of-sample performance of traditional predictors such as the dividend-to-price ratio. Finally, I show the predictability afforded by proxies for the variance risk premium is not robust to WLS-EV.}

  abstract = {The physical and chemical properties as well as the oxidative potential (OP) of water soluble components of coal combustion fine particles were examined. A laboratory-scale pulverizedcoal burning system was used to produce coal combustion particles at different burning temperatures of 550 C, 700 C, 900 C, and 1,100 C. Few studies have reported the effects of burning temperature on both the chemistry and toxicity of coal combustion particles. The highest mass emission factor of particulate matter less than 2.5 mm (PM2.5) was found to be produced at 700 C (3.51 g/kg), owing to strong elemental carbon (EC) emission and ash formation (ions and elements) resulting from the incomplete combustion of tar and char, and mineral fragmentation. The highest organic carbon in PM2.5 was found at 550 C. At a temperature higher than 700 C, the fraction of carbonaceous species decreased while the fractions of ions and elements increased owing to ash formation. Sulfate was found to be the dominant ionic species, followed by sodium, calcium, and magnesium. The highest emission of elements (Al, As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr, Ti, V, and Zn) and the highest fractions of Fe and Al were observed at 700 C. Intrinsic OP activities obtained from dithiothreitol (DTT) and electron spin resonance (ESR) assays showed the highest values at 550 C, suggesting that fine particles from low-temperature coal combustion had the highest reactive oxygen species generation capability (potentially toxic) among various tested burning temperatures. The results of principal component analysis suggested a correlation between OP-DTT activity and OC, EC, Cd, Co, V, and Zn, while OP-ESR activity was associated with chloride, nitrate, Ba, Pb, Sr, and Ti.},

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which the performance of the DTT and DCFH has been compared with the BPEAnit probe. The average concentrations of PM, organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) for fine (PM2.5) and coarse (PM10) particles were determined. The results were 44.8 ± 13.7, 9.8 ± 5.1 and 9.3 ± 4.8 µg·m−3 for PM2.5 and 75.5 ± 25.1, 16.3 ± 8.7 and 11.8 ± 5.3 µg·m−3 for PM10, respectively, for PM, OC and EC. The water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) fraction accounted for 42 ± 14\% and 28 ± 9\% of organic carbon in PM2.5 and PM10, respectively. The average volume normalized OP values for the three assays depended on both the sampling periods and the PM fractions. The OPBPEAnit had its peak at 2 p.m.; in the afternoon, it was three times higher compared to the morning and late afternoon values. The DCFH and BPEAnit results were correlated (r = 0.64), while there was no good agreement between the BPEAnit and the DTT (r = 0.14). The total organic content of PM does not necessarily represent oxidative capacity and it shows varying correlation with the OP. With respect to the two PM fractions studied, the OP was mostly associated with smaller particles.},

Flexible statistical methods for prediction have demonstrated the integration of satellite observations with other predictors, yet these algorithms are susceptible to overfitting the spatiotemporal structure of the training datasets. We present a new approach for predicting PM2.5 using machine-learning methods and evaluating prediction models for the goal of making predictions where they were not previously available. We apply extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) modeling to predict daily PM2.5 on a 1 × 1 km2 resolution for a 13 state region in the Northeastern USA for the years 2000–2015 using satellite-derived aerosol optical depth and implement a recursive feature selection to develop a parsimonious model. We demonstrate excellent predictions of withheld observations but also contrast an RMSE of 3.11 μg/m3 in our spatial cross-validation withholding nearby sites versus an overfit RMSE of 2.10 μg/m3 using a more conventional random ten-fold splitting of the dataset. As the field of exposure science moves forward with the use of advanced machine-learning approaches for spatiotemporal modeling of air pollutants, our results show the importance of addressing data leakage in training, overfitting to spatiotemporal structure, and the impact of the predominance of ground monitoring sites in dense urban sub-networks on model evaluation. The strengths of our resultant modeling approach for exposure in epidemiologic studies of PM2.5 include improved efficiency, parsimony, and interpretability with robust validation while still accommodating complex spatiotemporal relationships.},

METHODS: We propose an interdisciplinary conceptual framework that brings together maternal and infant nutrition, air pollution exposure assessment, and cardiopulmonary and perinatal epidemiology. Five possible albeit not exclusive biologic mechanisms have been put forth in the emerging environmental sciences literature and provide corollaries for the proposed framework. CONCLUSIONS: Protecting the environmental health of mothers and infants remains a top global priority. The existing literature indicates that the effects of PM on LBW, PTD, and IUGR may manifest through the cardiovascular mechanisms of oxidative stress, inflammation, coagulation, endothelial function, and hemodynamic responses. PM exposure studies relating mechanistic pathways to perinatal outcomes should consider the likelihood that biologic responses and adverse birth outcomes may be derived from both PM and non-PM sources (e.g., nutrition). In the concluding section, we present strategies for empirically testing the proposed model and developing future research efforts.},

Source apportionment was performed in an urban area where representative types of emission sources are present. PM10 and PM2 samples were collected within the Athens Metropolitan area and analysed for trace elements, inorganic ions and black carbon. Analysis by two-way and three-way Positive Matrix Factorization was performed, in order to resolve sources from data obtained for the fine and coarse aerosol fractions. A difference was observed: seven factors describe the best solution in PMF3 while six factors in PMF2. Six factors derived from PMF3 analysis correspond to those described by the PMF2 solution for the fine and coarse particles separately. These sources were attributed to road dust, marine aerosol, soil, motor vehicles, biomass burning, and oil combustion. The additional source resolved by PMF3 was attributed to a different type of road dust. Combustion sources (oil combustion and biomass burning) were correctly attributed by PMF3 solely to the fine fraction and the soil source to the coarse fraction. However, a motor vehicle’s contribution to the coarse fraction was found only by three-way PMF. When PMF2 was employed in PM10 concentrations the optimum solution included six factors. Four source profiles corresponded to the previously identified as vehicles, road dust, biomass burning and marine aerosol, while two could not be clearly identified. Source apportionment by PMF2 analysis based solely on PM10 aerosol composition data, yielded unclear results, compared to results from PMF2 and PMF3 analyses on fine and coarse aerosol composition data.},

  abstract = {Marine aerosol samples collected from the North Pacific atmosphere were studied for molecular distributions of dicarboxylic acids by using a capillary gas chromatography and mass spectrometery. A homologous series of dicarboxylic acids (C 2-C 10) was detected in the marine aerosol samples as dibutyl esters. All the samples showed that the smallest diacid (oxalic acid: C 2) was the most abundant and comprised 41-67\% of the total diacids. The second most abundant species was malonic acid (C 3) or succinic acid (C 4). The diacids with more carbon numbers were generally less abundant. Total diacid concentration range was 17-1040 ng m-3 , which accounted for up to 1.6\% of total aerosol mass. This indicates that low molecular weight dicarboxylic acids are important class of organic compounds in the marine atmosphere. The concentrations were generally higher in the western North Pacific and lower in the central North Pacific. The major portion of diacids is probably derived from the Asian Continent and East Asian countries by long-range atmospheric transport and partly from in situ photochemical production in the marine atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Low molecular weight dicarboxylic acids have been studied in the urban aerosol samples collected from Tokyo atmosphere in 1988-1989, by using a capillary GC and GC-MS method employing a dibutyl ester derivatization technique. A homologous series of C2-C10 dicarboxylic acids were detected in the aerosols, including straight-chain saturated, unsaturated, branched-chain, and hy-droxylated species. Molecular distributions of the diacids demonstrated that oxalic (C2) acid was the most abundant throughout the four seasons, followed by C3 and C4 diacids: the C2 diacid comprised 37-69 \% of the total diacid concentrations. The diacids with more carbon numbers were less abundant, although C6 and C9 diacids were relatively abundant. Total concentrations of the diacids ranged from 90 to 1370 ng nr3, which correspond to 0.06-1.1\% of the total aerosol mass. Their concentrations relative to aerosol mass showed a seasonal trend with a maximum in August. The C2-C4 diacid carbon normalized by aerosol total carbon also showed a strong seasonal change with a maximum in the summer and indicated a positive correlation with oxidant concentrations. Interestingly , lower diacids showed higher values for correlation coefficient (e.g., r = 0.80 for oxalic acid), suggesting a preferential production of low molecular weight dicar-boxylic acids, especially, C2 diacid. Possible reaction mechanisms are discussed in relation to the preferential accumulation of lower diacids in the atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Oxalate, the anion of oxalic acid, is one of the most abundant measurable organic species in atmospheric aerosols. Traditionally, this bifunctional species has been measured by gas chromatography (GC) after derivatization to butyl ester and by ion chromatography (IC) without derivatization. However, there are few published comparisons of the two techniques. Here, we report the results of an intercomparison study for the measurement of oxalic acid in Arctic aerosols ({$<$} 2.5 µm, n=82) collected in 1992 using GC and IC. The concentrations of oxalic acid by GC ranged from 6.5-59.1 ng m-3 (av. 26.0 ng m-3 , median 26.2 ng m-3) whereas those by IC ranged from 6.6-52.1 ng m-3 (av. 26.6 ng m-3 , median 25.4 ng m-3). They showed a good correlation (r=0.84) with a slope of 0.96. Thus, observations of oxalate obtained by GC employing dibutyl esters are almost equal to those by IC. Because the accuracy of oxalic acid by GC method largely depends on the method used, it is important to strictly examine the recovery in each study.},

  abstract = {This review aims to update our understanding on molecular distributions of water-soluble dicarboxylic acids and related compounds in atmospheric aerosols with a focus on their geographical variability, size distribution, sources and formation pathways. In general, molecular distributions of diacids in aerosols from the continental sites and over the open ocean waters are often characterized by the predominance of oxalic acid (C2) followed by malonic acid (C3) and/or succinic acid (C4), while those sampled over the polar regions often follow the order of C4≥C2 and C3. The most abundant and ubiquitous diacid is oxalic acid, which is principally formed via atmospheric oxidation of its higher homologues of long chain diacids and other pollution-derived organic precursors (e.g., olefins and aromatic hydrocarbons). However, its occurrence in marine aerosols is mainly due to the transport from continental outflows (e.g., East Asian outflow during winter/spring to the North Pacific) and/or governed by photochemical/aqueous phase oxidation of biogenic unsaturated fatty acids (e.g., oleic acid) and isoprene emitted from the productive open ocean waters. The long-range atmospheric transport of pollutants from mid latitudes to the Arctic in dark winter facilitates to accumulate the reactants prior to their intense photochemical oxidation during springtime polar sunrise. Furthermore, the relative abundances of C2 in total diacid mass showed similar temporal trends with downward solar irradiation and ambient temperatures, suggesting the significance of atmospheric photochemical oxidation processing. Compound-specific isotopic analyses of oxalic acid showed the highest δ13C among diacids whereas azelaic acid showed the lowest value, corroborating the significance of atmospheric aging of oxalic acid. On the other hand, other diacids gave intermediate values between these two diacids, suggesting that aging of oxalic acid is associated with 13C enrichment.},

  abstract = {Whilst performing its normal functions the lung is required to deal with a range of toxic insults. Whether these are infectious agents, allergens or air pollutants they subject the lung to a range of direct and indirect oxidative stresses. In many instances these challenges lead to oxidative alterations of peptides and proteins within the lung. Measurement of protein oxidation products permits the degree of oxidative stress to be assessed and indicates that endogenous antioxidant defences are overwhelmed. The range of protein oxidation products observed is diverse and the nature and extent of specific oxidation products may inform us about the nature of the damaging ROS and NOS. Recently, there has been a significant shift away from the measurement of these oxidation products simply to establish the presence of oxidative stress, to a focus on identifying specific proteins sensitive to oxidation and establishing the functional consequences of these modifications. In addition the identification of specific enzyme systems to repair these oxidative modifications has lead to the belief that protein function may be regulated through these oxidation reactions. In this review we focus primarily on the soluble protein components of within the surface liquid layer in the lung and the consequence of their undue oxidation.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The health implications of PM2.5 in the tropical region of Southeast Asia (SEA) are significant as PM2.5 can pose serious health concerns. PM2.5 concentration and sources here are strongly influenced by changes in the monsoon regime from the south-west quadrant to the north-east quadrant in the region. In this work, PM2.5 samples were collected at a semi-urban area using a high-volume air sampler at different seasons on 24\,h basis. Analysis of trace elements and water-soluble ions was performed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) and ion chromatography (IC), respectively. Apportionment analysis of PM2.5 was carried out using the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) positive matrix factorization (PMF) 5.0 and a mass closure model. We quantitatively characterized the health risks posed to human populations through the inhalation of selected heavy metals in PM2.5. 48\,\% of the samples collected exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) 24\,h PM2.5 guideline but only 19\,\% of the samples exceeded 24\,h US EPA National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). The PM2.5 concentration was slightly higher during the north-east monsoon compared to south-west monsoon. The main trace metals identified were As, Pb, Cd, Ni, Mn, V, and Cr while the main ions were SO42−, NO3−, NH4+, and Na. The mass closure model identified four major sources of PM2.5 that account for 55\,\% of total mass balance. The four sources are mineral matter (MIN) (35\,\%), secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) (11\,\%), sea salt (SS) (7\,\%), and trace elements (TE) (2\,\%). PMF~5.0 elucidated five potential sources: motor vehicle emissions coupled with biomass burning (31\,\%) were the most dominant, followed by marine/sulfate aerosol (20\,\%), coal burning (19\,\%), nitrate aerosol (17\,\%), and mineral/road dust (13\,\%). The hazard quotient (HQ) for four selected metals (Pb, As, Cd, and Ni) in PM2.5 mass was highest in PM2.5 mass from the coal burning source and least in PM2.5 mass originating from the mineral/road dust source. The main carcinogenic heavy metal of concern to health at the current location was As; the other heavy metals (Ni, Pb, and Cd) did not pose a significant cancer risk in PM2.5 mass concentration. Overall, the associated lifetime cancer risk posed by the exposure of hazardous metals in PM2.5 is 3–4 per 1\,000\,000 people at this location.},

  abstract = {The health effects of ambient air particulate matter with a diameter of ≤ 2.5 micrometersμm (PM2.5) on the central nervous system are well known and the induced oxidative stress has been shown as their main neuropathologic outcome. Ambient air PM2.5 sampling methods mostly use air sampler systems that collect PM2.5 on filters, which is followed by a PM2.5 extraction approach. Inefficient extraction may lead to compositional bias and unreal interpretation of the results. This study aimed to compare our proposed multisolvent extraction (MSE) approach for PM2.5 extraction with a conventional aqueous extraction (AqE) method using the analysis of oxidative effects and cytotoxicity in the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line. Ambient PM2.5 samples were collected from an urban traffic location in Tehran city, the capital of Iran, using a high-volume sampler. The developed MSE method was proved to have superior advantages over the AqE method including an increased extraction efficiency (as much as 96 against 48 percent\% for PMms and PMaq, respectively), and decreased artifacts and compositional biases. Ambient PM2.5, besides PMms and PMaq were analyzed for water-soluble ions, metals, and major elements. Dithiothreitol, ascorbic acid, lipid peroxidation, and cell viability assays on SH-SY5Y cells represented the significantly higher oxidative potential for PMms compared to PMaq. The increased cytotoxicity may occur because of the increased oxidative potential of PMms and possibly is associated with higher efficiency of the MSE over the AqE method for removal of total redox-active PM components.},

A total of 16 elements in 945 daily PM2.5 samples were measured. The PMF results indicated that seven sources independently contribute to the observed PM2.5 mass: vegetative burning (44\%), sulfate aerosol (19\%), motor vehicle (11\%), nitrate aerosol (9\%), airborne soil (9\%), chlorinerich source (6\%) and metal processing (3\%). Conditional probability functions were computed using surface wind data and the PMF deduced mass contributions from each source and were used to identify local point sources.

To analyze local point source impacts from various wind directions, CPF and NPR were calculated using the source contributions estimated from PMF coupled with wind direction measured on site. The comparison between CPF and NPR demonstrated that both methods agreed well with the locations of known local point sources. CPF was simpler and easier to calculate than NPR. In contrast, NPR provided PM2.5 concentrations and associated uncertainties.

Positive matrix factorization was conducted on the PM2.5 chemical speciation data from the samples to define the pathways and sources of PM2.5 at the sampling site.

Conditional probability and potential source contribution functions were then used to determine whether these sources were local or came from pollutants transported over long-range distances.

  abstract = {Source apportionment results of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 µm (PM2.5) from two multivariate receptor models (positive matrix factorization, PMF; solver for mixture problem, SMP) were compared to assess the comparability of the results in view of model performance, source identification and source quantification. Two receptor models applied the same filter samples of PM2.5 collected between October 2012 and September 2013 in Seoul, Korea, not only reproduced well the measured PM2.5 mass concentrations, especially the SMP model (R2=0.99, bias= −0.02 μg m−3), but also identified the four major PM2.5 contributors: biomass burning (PMF: 12.0\%, SMP: 13.2\%), vehicles (PMF: 18.9\%, SMP: 10.2\%), road dust (PMF: 5.0\%, SMP: 11.2\%) and secondary aerosol sources (PMF: 51\%, SMP: 42.5\%). The large sulfate fraction in the source profile is thought to be the high vehicle fraction in PMF. The major species constituting the secondary aerosols are OC (PMF: 11.7\%, SMP: 16.2\%), sulfate (PMF: 21.2\%, SMP: 15.3\%), nitrate (PMF: 29.4\%, SMP: 44.1\%), and ammonium (PMF: 16.7\%, SMP: 16.9\%). The difference in the contribution of nitrate and sulfate between the two models underscores that multiple receptor models may need to be applied to the same dataset to better understand their sources in polluted areas, particularly reducing secondary aerosols.},

Parameters that influence probe response were first characterized to develop an optimal method for use in a field instrument. The online method used a mist chamber scrubber to collect total (gas plus particle) ROS components (ROSt) alternating with gas phase ROS (ROSg) by means of an inline filter. Particle phase ROS (ROSp) was determined by the difference between ROSt and ROSg. The instrument was deployed in urban Atlanta, Georgia, USA, and at a rural site during various seasons. Concentrations from the online instrument generally agreed well with those from an intensive filter measurement of ROSp. Concentrations of the ROSp measurements made with this instrument were lower than reported in other studies, often below the instrument's average limit of detection (0.15 nmol H2O2 equivalents m-3). Mean ROSp concentrations were 0.26 nmol H2O2 equivalents m-3 at the Atlanta urban sites compared to 0.14 nmol H2O2 equivalents m-3 at the rural site. © 2013 Author(s).}

  abstract = {The wavelength dependence of light absorption by aerosols collected on filters is investigated throughout the near‐ultraviolet to near‐infrared spectral region. Measurements were made using an optical transmission method. Aerosols produced by biomass combustion, including wood and savanna burning, and by motor vehicles, including diesel trucks, are included in the analysis. These aerosol types were distinguished by different wavelength (λ) dependences in light absorption. Light absorption by the motor vehicle aerosols exhibited relatively weak wavelength dependence; absorption varied approximately as λ               −1               , indicating that black carbon (BC) was the dominant absorbing aerosol component. By contrast, the biomass smoke aerosols had much stronger wavelength dependence, approximately λ               −2               . The stronger spectral dependence was the result of enhanced light absorption at wavelengths shorter than 600 nm and was largely reduced when much of the sample organic carbon (OC) was extracted by dissolution in acetone. This indicates that OC in addition to BC in the biomass smoke aerosols contributed significantly to measured light absorption in the ultraviolet and visible spectral regions and that OC in biomass burning aerosols may appreciably absorb solar radiation. Estimated absorption efficiencies and imaginary refractive indices are presented for the OC extracted from biomass burning samples and the BC in motor vehicle‐dominated aerosol samples. The uncertainty of these constants is discussed. Overall, results of this investigation show that low‐temperature, incomplete combustion processes, including biomass burning, can produce light‐absorbing aerosols that exhibit much stronger spectral dependence than high‐temperature combustion processes, such as diesel combustion.},

We aimed to assess the concentration of PAHs-bound to particulate matter (PM), source apportionment and carcinogenic risk due to inhalation exposure to PAHs. We selected 30 sampling locations in Sabzevar, Iran (2021). PM bounds-PAHs samples were collected using a PM passive sampler. Monte Carlo simulation technique with sensitivity analysis was used to assess the carcinogenic risk of inhalation exposure to PAHs. The Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model was used for source apportionment of ambient PAHs. The median (iterquartile range (IQR)) of total PAHs was 1056.2 (848.5) ppb. The median (IQR) ratio of total LMW/HMW PAHs was 1.9 (1.4), indicating petrogenic sources of PAHs. The 95th percentile of lifetime cancer risk (LTCR) for children, adolescents, and adults in both genders was higher than the threshold level recommended by USEPA (i.e., 1  106). The PMF model indicated five possible PAH sources, including combustion of biomass, natural gas, combustion petroleum-based fuels, traffic sources of mixed gasoline and diesel combustion, and industrial activities. The spatial autocorrelation models indicated a clustered distribution pattern for all PAHs congeners except Anthracene. Our results suggested that point sources of ambient PAHs should be paid more attention to in urban areas. Moreover, inhalation exposure to ambient PAHs had a potential carcinogenic risk for the inhabitant of Sabzevar.},

  abstract = {Secondary organic aerosol (SOA), particulate matter composed of compounds formed from the atmospheric transformation of organic species, accounts for a substantial fraction of tropospheric aerosol. The formation of low-volatility (semivolatile and possibly nonvolatile) compounds that make up SOA is governed by a complex series of reactions of a large number of organic species, so the experimental characterization and theoretical description of SOA formation presents a substantial challenge. In this review we outline what is known about the chemistry of formation and continuing transformation of low-volatility species in the atmosphere. The primary focus is chemical processes that can change the volatility of organic compounds: (1) oxidation reactions in the gas phase, (2) reactions in the particle phase, and (3) continuing chemistry (in either phase) over several generations. Gas-phase oxidation reactions can reduce volatility by the addition of polar functional groups or increase it by the cleavage of carbon-carbon bonds; key branch points that control volatility are the initial attack of the oxidant, reactions of alkylperoxy (RO2) radicals, and reactions of alkoxy (RO) radicals. Reactions in the particle phase include oxidation reactions as well as accretion reactions, non-oxidative processes leading to the formation of high-molecular-weight species. Organic carbon in the atmosphere is continually subject to reactions in the gas and particle phases throughout its atmospheric lifetime (until lost by physical deposition or oxidized to CO or CO2), implying continual changes in volatility over the timescales of several days. The volatility changes arising from these chemical reactions must be parameterized and included in models in order to gain a quantitative and predictive understanding of SOA formation. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed to evaluate two clustering algorithms: k-means clustering (kMC) and spectral clustering (SC) as potential receptor models for source apportionment. The application of kMC produced unsatisfactory results, but the results obtained from SC demonstrated a significant correlation with the results obtained using positive matrix factorization (PMF). The clustering results obtained were associated with practical evidence available in the literature. SC identified six source factors on analyzing two carbon fractions data set and seven factors from eight temperature-resolved carbon fractions data set. The sources (source contribution in parentheses) identified are: combustion (45.9 ± 3.66\%) and secondary sulfate (11.4 ± 1.09\%), vegetative/wood burning (17.5 ± 1.46\%), diesel (10.6 ± 0.92\%) and gasoline (3.6 ± 0.33\%) vehicles, soil/crustal (2.07 ± 0.2\%), traffic (9.3 ± 0.81\%), and metal processing (8.8 ± 0.72\%).

However, there is subjectivity in the source identification and labelling due to manual interpretation, which is time-consuming. This raises a barrier to the development of the real-time SA process. In this study, a machine learning (ML) classification algorithm, k-nearest neighbour (kNN), is applied to the source profiles obtained from the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (U.S. EPA) SPECIATE database to develop a model that can automatically label the factors derived from FA receptor models. The train and test score of the model is 0.85 and 0.79, respectively. The overall weighted average precision, recall and F1 score is 0.79. The performance of the model during validation exhibits acceptable results. The application of ML models for source profile labelling will reduce the time taken and the subjectivity associated with results due to modeler bias. This process can act as another layer of the process for verification of the results of FA receptor models. The application of this methodology advances the process towards real-time SA.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: It has been proposed that the redox activity of particles may represent a major determinant of their toxicity. We measured the in vitro ability of ambient fine particles [particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters ≤ 2.5 µm (PM2.5)] to form hydroxyl radicals (·OH) in an oxidant environment, as well as to deplete physiologic antioxidants (ascorbic acid, glutathione) in the naturally reducing environment of the respiratory tract lining fluid (RTLF). The objective was to examine how these toxicologically relevant measures were related to other PM characteristics, such as total and elemental mass concentration and light absorbance. DESIGN: Gravimetric PM2.5 samples (n = 716) collected over 1 year from 20 centers participating in the European Community Respiratory Health Survey were available. Light absorbance of these filters was measured with reflectometry. PM suspensions were recovered from filters by vortexing and sonication before dilution to a standard concentration. The oxidative activity of these particle suspensions was then assessed by measuring their ability to generate ·OH in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, using electron spin resonance and 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide as spin trap, or by establishing their capacity to deplete antioxidants from a synthetic model of the RTLF. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: PM oxidative activity varied significantly among European sampling sites. Correlations between oxidative activity and all other characteristics of PM were low, both within centers (temporal correlation) and across communities (annual mean). Thus, no single surrogate measure of PM redox activity could be identified. Because these novel measures are suggested to reflect crucial biologic mechanisms of PM, their use may be pertinent in epidemiologic studies. Therefore, it is important to define the appropriate methods to determine oxidative activity of PM.},

  abstract = {New York City (NYC) is presently in violation of the nation’s PM2.5 annual mass standard, and will have to take actions to control the sources contributing to these violations. This paper seeks to differentiate the impact of long-range transported aerosols on the air quality of downtown NYC, so that the roles of local sources can more clearly be evaluated. Past source apportionment studies have considered single sites individually in their source apportionment analyses to identify and determine sources affecting that site, often finding secondary sulfates to be an important contributor, but not being able to quantify the portion that is transported vs. local. In this study, a rural site located in Sterling Forest, NY, which is near to the NYC area, but unaffected by local NYC sources, is instead used as a reference to separate the portion of the aerosol that is transported to our Manhattan, NYC site before conducting the source apportionment analysis. Sterling Forest is confirmed as a background site via elemental comparisons with NYC during regional transport episodes of Asian and Sahara sandstorm dusts, as well as by comparisons with a second background site in Chester, NJ. Two different approaches that incorporate Sterling Forest background data into the NYC source apportionment analysis are then applied to quantify local vs. transported aerosols. Six source categories are identified for NYC: regional transported sulfate, trans-continental desert dust, traffic, residual oil, ‘‘local’’ dust and World Trade Center fires pollution. Of these, the transported sulfates and trans-continental desert dust accounted for nearly half of the total PM2.5 mass in Manhattan during 2001, with more than half coming from these transported sources during the summer months. More than 90\% of the Manhattan elemental carbon was found to be of local origins. Conversely, roughly 90\% of the NYC sulfate mass was identified as transported into the city. Our results indicate that transported pollution has a major role in NYC’s fine PM pollution. Reliably meeting the ambient PM2.5 air quality standards in New York will require that upwind sources, outside of the city, will also need to be controlled.},

  abstract = {Submicron ambient aerosol was characterized in summer 2005 at an urban background site in Zurich, Switzerland, during a three-week measurement campaign. Highly time-resolved samples of non-refractory aerosol components were analyzed with an Aerodyne aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS). Positive matrix factorization (PMF) was used for the first time for aerosol mass spectra to identify the main components of the total organic aerosol and their sources. The PMF retrieved factors were compared to measured reference mass spectra and were correlated with tracer species of the aerosol and gas phase measurements from collocated instruments. Six factors were found to explain virtually all variance in the data and could be assigned either to sources or to aerosol components such as oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA). Our analysis suggests that at the measurement site only a small ({$<$}10\%) fraction of organic PM1 originates from freshly emitted fossil fuel combustion. Other primary sources identified to be of similar or even higher importance are charbroiling (10–15\%) and wood burning (∼10\%). The fraction of all identified primary sources is considered as primary organic aerosol (POA). This interpretation is supported by calculated ratios of the modelled POA and measured primary pollutants such as elemental carbon (EC), NOx, and CO, which are in good agreement to literature values. A high fraction (60–69\%) of the measured organic aerosol mass is OOA which is interpreted mostly as secondary organic aerosol (SOA). This oxygenated organic aerosol can be separated into a highly aged fraction, OOA I, (40–50\%) with low volatility and a mass spectrum similar to fulvic acid, and a more volatile and probably less processed fraction, OOA II (on average 20\%). This is the first publication of a multiple component analysis technique to AMS organic spectral data and also the first report of the OOA II component.},

  abstract = {The present study investigates persistent inversions dynamics during a whole winter in Alpine valleys of the area of Grenoble (French Alps), and their relationship to PM10 air pollution episodes and synoptic scale meteorology. For this purpose, hourly time series from November to March of PM10 concentration measurements at the bottom of the valleys and of ground-based temperature data at different altitudes are used. A methodology is developed to quantify a simple estimate of the inversion strength from temperature profiles deduced from the ground-based observations. This estimate is shown to be equivalent to the boundary layer heat deficit. A criterion based on this estimate is proposed to identify persistent (more than 3 days) inversions. Persistent inversions are found to occur from November to February and span 35\% of the time. It is shown that they are closely related to PM10 pollution episodes, the PM10 concentration increasing with the boundary layer stability as the inversion develops. Polluted episodes are primarily driven by persistent inversions and consequently, pollution is of fully local origin from November to February. In March local dynamics become less important and long-range transport can dominate. Persistent inversions occur systematically during a high-pressure regime, which first triggers a synoptic scale elevated inversion due to the advection of warm air masses in the mid-troposphere. In valleys, the sheltered boundary layer becomes decoupled from the free troposphere, which allows a ground-based inversion to intensify in the following days. An inversion layer of quasi-constant temperature gradient, greater than 5 K km-1, then forms up to an altitude of about 1600 m, close to the average elevation of the summits. If the episode is sufficiently long, a stagnation stage is reached during which daytime insolation produces a shallow convective surface layer which does not destroy the persistent inversion. The inversion break-up occurs rapidly, in less than a day, because of synoptic scale advection of cold air masses in the mid-troposphere when a low-pressure regime approaches. The end-of-episode decrease in PM10 concentration is due to precipitation combined with an increased ventilation inside the boundary-layer.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposure to fine particulate matter air pollution with aerodynamic diameter ≤2:5 lm (PM2:5) has been associated with preterm delivery and low birth weight (LBW), but few studies have examined possible effect modification by PM2:5 oxidative potential. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate if regional differences in the oxidative potential of PM2:5 modify the relationship between PM2:5 and adverse birth outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using 196,171 singleton births that occurred in 31 cities in the province of Ontario, Canada, from 2006 to 2012. Daily air pollution data were collected from ground monitors, and city-level PM2:5 oxidative potential was measured. We used random-effects meta-analysis to combine the estimates of effect from regression models across cities on preterm birth, term LBW, and term birth weight and used meta-regression to evaluate the modifying effect of PM2:5 oxidative potential. RESULTS: An interquartile increase (2:6 lg=m3) in first-trimester PM2:5 was positively associated with term LBW among women in the highest quartile of glutathione (GSH)-related oxidative potential [odds ratio ðORÞ = 1:28; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.10, 1.48], but not the lowest quartile (OR = 0:99; 95\% CI: 0.87, 1.14; p-interaction = 0:03). PM2:5 on the day of delivery also was associated with preterm birth among women in the highest quartile of GSH-related oxidative potential [hazard ratio ðHRÞ = 1:02; 95\% CI: 1.01, 1.04], but not the lowest quartile [HR = 0:97; 95\% CI: 0.95, 1.00; p-interaction = 0:04]. Between-city differences in ascorbate (AA)-related oxidative potential did not significantly modify associations with PM2:5. CONCLUSIONS: Between-city differences in GSH-related oxidative potential may modify the impact of PM2:5 on the risk of term LBW and preterm birth. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2535},

  abstract = {Abstract. This work focuses on filling the knowledge gap associated with the contribution of natural and anthropogenic marine emissions to PM10 concentrations in northern France. For this purpose, a 1-year measurement and sampling campaign for PM10 has been conducted at a French coastal site situated at the Strait of Dover. The characterization of PM10 samples was performed considering major and trace elements, water-soluble ions, organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), and organic markers of biomass burning and primary biogenic emissions. Furthermore, the source apportionment of PM10 was achieved using the constrained weighted non-negative matrix factorization (CW-NMF) model. The annual average PM10 was 24.3\,µg\,m−3, with six species contributing 69\,\% of its mass (NO3-, OC, SO42-, Cl−, Na+, and NH4+). The source apportionment of PM10 led to the identification of 9 sources. On average yearly, fresh and aged sea salts contributed 37\,\% of PM10, while secondary nitrate and sulfate contributed 42\,\%, biomass burning contributed 8\,\%, and heavy-fuel-oil (HFO) combustion from shipping emissions contributed almost 5\,\%. Additionally, monthly evolution of the sources' contribution evidenced different behaviors with high contributions of secondary nitrate and biomass burning during winter. In the summer season, 15-times-higher concentrations for HFO combustion (July compared to January) and the predominance of aged sea salts versus fresh sea salts were observed.The concentration-weighted trajectory model showed that the sources contributing more than 80\,\% of PM10 at Cap Gris-Nez are of regional and/or long-range origins, with the North Sea and the English Channel as hotspots for natural and anthropogenic marine emissions and Belgium, the Netherlands, and the west of Germany as hotspots for secondary inorganic aerosols.},

Source apportionment results using the two receptor models are analyzed and compared. Both models are able to identify major sources at all sites, though the degree of agreements and correlations between source impacts estimated by PMF and CMB varies depending on sources and receptor sites. Estimated contributions of secondary inorganic particles are the most comparable and highly correlated. The lesser comparability and correlations of estimated contributions of other sources (mostly primary) may be attributed to several factors. Resolved source profiles in PMF have more processed (or aged) characteristics resulting in part from atmospheric mixing and condensation of oxidized compounds, whereas source profiles used in CMB are obtained from measurements of emission sources with minimum amount of atmospheric processing. The PMF profiles vary from site to site; both atmospheric processing and local source variability contribute. In comparison, the CMB profiles obtained from a limited number of emission measurements may not be locally representative even if they are regionally representative. The omission of possible known or unknown sources due to lack of proper source profiles or proper "marker" species may also cause the differences in the source apportionment results. In addition, the implication for PM time-series health study is discussed based on the results from this study. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

These investigations were done on selected discrete ice cores sections extracted from Mount Rosa and Mount Blanc glaciers covering the 20th century and extending back to previous centuries. Here we focus on major changes in summer ice layers. Among carbonaceous components, EC reveals an outstanding increase with a sharp summer increase after World War II. This result is discussed against available past EC emission inventories in Europe which are thought to be mainly driven by emissions from road transport and residential sector. The long-term trend of organic carbon (OC) aerosol preserved in ice, WinOC as well as water soluble organic carbon (WSOC), was successfully reconstructed using the suitable array of organic compounds we investigated in this study. It is shown that the level of OC preserved in ice has increased by a factor of 2 after 1950 likely as a result of the enhancement of the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere over the last decades producing more secondary organic atmospheric aerosol from biogenic gaseous precursors.

The lowest concentrations of total C2-C5 diacids are observed at the Azores (Portugal) and at 4360 m elevation in the Alps (∼50 ng m-3 ), and the highest (400 ng m-3) are observed at the rural K-puszta site (Hungary). Quasi-absent at surface sites, the seasonal cycle of total diacids is characterized by a pronounced summer maximum at elevated sites, the highest summer level (510 ng m-3) being observed at the forested mountain site of Schauinsland (Germany). Whatever site and season, oxalic acid is always the most abundant diacid with a relative abundance higher than 60\%. The climatology Of C2-C5 diacids in Europe is discussed versus environmental conditions at sites (marine/continental, rural/forested, boundary layer/free troposphere, and winter/summer). Observations are used to discuss the possible sources of C2-C5 diacids, with special emphasis on their primary versus secondary and natural versus anthropogenic origin. At surface sites in winter, fast secondary productions in wood burning plumes in addition to secondary production from volatile organic carbon (VOC) species emitted by vehicles seem to be important contributors. In summer the impact of anthropogenic sources is weakened and biogenic emissions from vegetation (unsaturated fatty acids, isoprene, oxygenated VOCs, and eventually monoterpenes) likely represent major precursors of diacids. At the Azores, diacids are not only related to long-range transport from continents but also to marine biogenic emissions from phytoplankton, particularly in summer.

Sixteen metals (K, Na, Ca, Mg, Al, Fe, Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd, As, Mn, Co, Ni, Cr, and V) were identified via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) assisted by microwave digestion. Concentrations of PM2.5 and the detected elements were the highest at Baoding and lowest at Huairou sites. Similar diurnal variations were observed at higher levels of PM2.5 and metals at night than during the day at four sites. Enrichment factor analysis indicated that Zn, As, Cu, Cd and Pb were the most abundant elements in the study area and originated from anthropogenic emissions. The positive matrix factorization (PMF) model was used to analyze the sources of PM2.5, namely, soil dust, vehicle emissions, fuel combustion, and coal combustion. The major source of metals in PM2.5 at the four sampling sites was soil dust and its contribution was above 35\%.

  abstract = {Ambient air pollution is one of the leading five health risks worldwide. One of the most harmful air pollutants is particulate matter (PM), which has different physical characteristics (particle size and number, surface area and morphology) and a highly complex and variable chemical composition. Our goal was first to comparatively assess the effects of exposure to PM regarding cytotoxicity, release of pro-inflammatory mediators and gene expression in human bronchial epithelia (HBE) reflecting normal and compromised health status. Second, we aimed at evaluating the impact of various PM components from anthropogenic and biogenic sources on the cellular responses. Air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures of fully differentiated HBE derived from normal and cystic fibrosis (CF) donor lungs were exposed at the apical cell surface to water-soluble PM filter extracts for 4 h. The particle dose deposited on cells was 0.9–2.5 and 8.8–25.4 μg per cm2 of cell culture area for low and high PM doses, respectively. Both normal and CF HBE show a clear dose-response relationship with increasing cytotoxicity at higher PM concentrations. The concurrently enhanced release of pro-inflammatory mediators at higher PM exposure levels links cytotoxicity to inflammatory processes. Further, the PM exposure deregulates genes involved in oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways leading to an imbalance of the antioxidant system. Moreover, we identify compromised defense against PM in CF epithelia promoting exacerbation and aggravation of disease. We also demonstrate that the adverse health outcome induced by PM exposure in normal and particularly in susceptible bronchial epithelia is magnified by anthropogenic PM components. Thus, including health-relevant PM components in regulatory guidelines will result in substantial human health benefits and improve protection of the vulnerable population.},

  abstract = {A receptor model of positive matrix factorization (PMF) was used to identify the emission sources of fine and coarse particulates in Bandung, a city located at about 150 km south-east of Jakarta. Total of 367 samples were collected at urban mixed site, Tegalega area, in Bandung City during wet and dry season in the period of 2001–2007. The samples of fine and coarse particulate matter were collected simultaneously using dichotomous samplers and mini-volume samplers. The Samples from dichotomous Samplers were analyzed for black carbon and elements while samples from mini-volume samplers were analyzed for ions. The species analyzed in this study were Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Pb, Cl, NO3, SO42, and NH4þ. The data were then analyzed using PMF to determine the source factors. Different numbers of source factors were found during dry and wet season. During dry season, the main source factors for fine particles were secondary aerosol (NH4)2SO4, electroplating industry, vehicle emission, and biomass burning, while for coarse particles, the dominant source factors were electroplating industry, followed by aged sea salt, volcanic dust, soil dust, and lime dust. During the wet season, the main source factors for fine particulate matter were vehicle emission and secondary aerosol. Other sources detected were biomass burning, lime dust, soil and volcanic dust. While for coarse particulate matter, the main source factors were sulphate-rich industry, followed by lime dust, soil dust, industrial emission and construction dust.},

  abstract = {Measurements in the Arctic troposphere over several years show that MSA concentrations in the atmospheric boundary layer, 0.08-6.1 parts per trillion (ppt, molar mixing ration), are lower that those over mid-latitude oceans. The seasonal cycle of MSA at Alert, Canada (82.5°N, 62.3°W), has two peaks of 6 ppt in March–April and July–August and minima of 0.3 ppt for the rest of the year. At Dye 3 (65°N, 44°W) on the Greenland Ice Sheet, a similar seasonal MSA cycle is observed although the concentrations are much lower with a maximum of 1 ppt. Around Barrow, Alaska (71.3°N, 156.8°W), MSA is between 1.0 and 25 ppt in July, higher than 1.5 ± 1.0 ppt in March–April. The mid-tropospheric MSA level of 0.6-1 ppt in the summer Arctic is much lower than about 6 ppt in the boundary layer. At Alert, the ratio of MSA to non-sea-salt (nss) SO42− ranges from 0.02 to 1.13 and is about 10 times higher in summer than in spring. The summer ratios are higher than found over mid-latitude regions and, when combined with reported sulfur isotope compositions from the Arctic, suggest that on average a significant fraction (about 16–23\%) of Arctic summer boundary layer sulfur is marine biogenic. The measurements show that the summer Arctic boundary layer has a significantly higher MSA/nss-SO42− ratio than aloft.},

  abstract = {Ambient particulate matter (PM) is an environmental factor that has been associated with increased respiratory morbidity and mortality. The major effect of ambient PM on the pulmonary system is the exacerbation of inflammation, especially in susceptible people. One of the mechanisms by which ambient PM exerts its proinflammatory effects is the generation of oxidative stress by its chemical compounds and metals. Cellular responses to PM-induced oxidative stress include activation of antioxidant defense, inflammation, and toxicity. The proinflammatory effect of PM in the lung is characterized by increased cytokine/chemokine production and adhesion molecule expression. Moreover, there is evidence that ambient PM can act as an adjuvant for allergic sensitization, which raises the possibility that long-term PM exposure may lead to increased prevalence of asthma. In addition to ambient PM, rapid expansion of nanotechnology has introduced the potential that engineered nanoparticles (NP) may also become airborne and may contribute to pulmonary diseases by novel mechanisms that could include oxidant injury. Currently, little is known about the potential adverse health effects of these particles. In this communication, the mechanisms by which particulate pollutants, including ambient PM and engineered NP, exert their adverse effects through the generation of oxidative stress and the impacts of oxidant injury in the respiratory tract will be reviewed. The importance of cellular antioxidant and detoxification pathways in protecting against particle-induced lung damage will also be discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

This review summarizes available data in the literature (2005-2012) on heavy metal polluted soils originating from mining areas in China. Based on these obtained data, this paper then evaluates the soil pollution levels of these collected mines and quantifies the risks these pollutants pose to human health. To assess these potential threat levels, the geoaccumulation index was applied, along with the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) recommended method for health risk assessment. The results demonstrate not only the severity of heavy metal pollution from the examined mines, but also the high carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks that soil heavy metal pollution poses to the public, especially to children and those living in the vicinity of heavily polluted mining areas. In order to provide key management targets for relevant government agencies, based on the results of the pollution and health risk assessments, Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn, Hg, As, and Ni are selected as the priority control heavy metals; tungsten, manganese, lead-zinc, and antimony mines are selected as the priority control mine categories; and southern provinces and Liaoning province are selected as the priority control provinces. This review, therefore, provides a comprehensive assessment of soil heavy metal pollution derived from mines in China, while identifying policy recommendations for pollution mitigation and environmental management of these mines. © 2013.},

A total of 23 studies published before July 2016 were collected and analyzed and the mean value of reported exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) ranged from 1.82 to 22.11 We found a significantly increased risk of preterm birth with interquartile range increase in PM2.5 exposure throughout pregnancy (odds ratio (OR) ¼ 1.03; 95\% conditional independence (CI): 1.01e1.05). The pooled OR for the association between PM2.5 exposure, per interquartile range increment, and term low birth weight throughout pregnancy was 1.03 (95\% CI: 1.02e1.03). The pooled ORs for the association between PM2.5 exposure per 10 increment, and term low birth weight and preterm birth were 1.05 (95\% CI: 0.98e1.12) and 1.02 (95\% CI: 0.93e1.12), respectively throughout pregnancy. There is a significant heterogeneity in most meta-analyses, except for pooled OR per interquartile range increase for term low birth weight throughout pregnancy. We here show that maternal exposure to fine particulate air pollution increases the risk of preterm birth and term low birth weight. However, the effect of exposure time needs to be further explored. In the future, prospective cohort studies and personal exposure measurements needs to be more widely utilized to better characterize the relationship between ambient fine particulate exposure and adverse birth outcomes.},

The concentrations of PM10 had been decreasing at both sites in three distinctive periods: 1) the initial PM10 levels approached or exceeded the Spain and EU PM10 annual guidelines of 40 μg/m3 during 2005–2007 at LL and 2005–2009 at PMY; 2) then PM10 dropped by 25\%–∼30 μg/m3 during 2008–2011 at LL and during 2010–2011 at PMY; 3) since 2012, the PM10 concentrations gradually decreased to {$<$}30 μg/m3. Chemical compositions of PM10 revealed the important contributions of water soluble ions (sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and chloride), carbonaceous aerosols, and other major elements. These PM components generally showed a decrease trend, in accord with the trend of PM10 reduction. A PMF model identified seven sources to PM10 contributions. Secondary sulfate, soil/urban/construction dust, and secondary nitrate showed significantly decreasing trends with reduction of 40–60\% comparing to the initial levels. The road traffic contribution decreased by 14\% from the first to third period. However, sea salt, oil combustion, and industrial metallurgical process had relative stable contributions. These source contribution changes are reasonably governed by the PM emission abatement actions implemented during the past decade, as well as the financial crisis, that accounted for a significant decrease of PM pollution in Southern Spain. The main finding of the work: We identified that the mitigation efforts on industry, fossil fuel combustion, and urban transportation during the past decade were successful for air quality improvement in a highly industrialized area in Southern Spain.},

Dithiothreitol (DTT) assay showed remarkable differences in the PM OPs among cities (p-values ≤ 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test). For example, the normalized index of oxidant generation (NIOG) of PM samples in San Francisco (2.20 × 10−2, annual average PM10 = 16 μg/m3) was found to be twice that in Beijing (1.14 × 10−2, annual average PM10 = 135 μg/m3). Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay found that PM-borne endotoxin ranged from 12.16 EU/mg (Florianopolis, Brazil) to 2518.23 EU/mg (Chennai, India) among cities. Besides, culturing method and real-time qPCR revealed significant differences of up to ∼100-fold in both bacterial and fungal levels among 19 cities.

  abstract = {Recent work has identified the presence of humic-like substances (HULIS) in ambient fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) in Beijing, China and that residential coal combustion as well as biomass burning are significant contributors to its presence. These results were based on the characterization of emissions from representative stoves and modeling of the aerosol with the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) chemical transport model. The CMAQ source apportionment estimated that residential coal and biofuel burning and secondary aerosol formation were important annual sources of ambient HULIS, contributing 47.1\%, 15.1\%, and 38.9\%, respectively. In this study, chemical composition data including concentrations of water-soluble organic carbon and HULIS across four seasons during 2012–2013 were analyzed with positive matrix factorization (PMF) to provide a complementary source apportionment. The PMF results indicate that the identified sources were Traffic, Biomass Burning, Nitrate/Sulfate, Incineration, Sulfate, Coal Combustion/Ammonium Chloride, Residential Coal/Biofuel Combustion, and Road Dust/Soil with mass contributions (fractions) to PM 2.5 of 12.35 (10.4\%), 8.70 (8.9\%), 24.51 (22.4\%), 5.64 (7.2\%), 25.14 (24.5\%), 7.10 (6.2\%), 14.18 (15.4\%), and 5.33 μg/m 3 (5.0\%), respectively. The contributions to the observed HULIS concentrations were 0.63 (10.9\%), 0.38 (6.4\%), 0.07 (1.7\%), 0.00 (0\%), 1.12 (28.8\%), 0.00 (0\%), 1.50 (52.2\%), and 0.01 μg/m 3 (0.3\%), respectively. These PMF modeling results were in reasonable agreement with the CMAQ values supporting the attribution of significant amounts of primary HULIS to residential coal and biofuel combustion. Currently, efforts are underway in China to replace solid fuel combustion for heating and cooking with natural gas and electricity by 2020. Thus, future studies should be able to see substantial reductions in both PM 2.5 and HULIS in the near term future.},

  abstract = {The major organic compositions from biomass burning emissions are monosaccharide derivatives from the breakdown of cellulose, generally accompanied by small amounts of straightchain, aliphatic, oxygenated compounds, and terpenoids from vegetation waxes, resins/gums, and other biopolymers. Levoglucosan from cellulose can be utilized as a specific or general indicator for biomass combustion emissions in aerosol samples. There are other important compounds, such as dehydroabietic acid, syringaldehyde, syringic acid, vanillic acid, vanillin, homovanillic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, and p-coumaric acid, which are additional key indicators of biomass burning. In this review, we will address these tracers from different types of biomass burning and the methods used to identify the sources in ambient aerosols. First, the methods of inferring biomass burning types by the ratio method are summarized, including levoglucosan/mannose, syringic acid/vanillic acid, levolgucosan/K+, vanillic acid/4-hydroxybenzoic acid, levoglucosan/OC, and levoglucosan/EC to infer the sources of biomass burning, such as crop residual burning, wheat burning, leaf burning, peatland fire, and forest fire in Asia. Second, we present the source tracer ratio methods that determine the biomass combustion types and their contributions. Finally, we introduce the PCA (Principal component analysis) and PMF (Positive matrix factor) methods to identify the type of biomass burning and its contributions according to emission factors of different species in various plants such as softwood, hardwood, and grass.},

  abstract = {This study aimed to conduct a meta-analysis to investigate whether short-term exposure to fine (PM2.5) and coarse (PM10) particulate matter was associated with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AeCOPD) hospitalization, emergency room visit, and outpatient visit at different lag values. PubMed, embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for relevant papers published up to March 2021. For studies reporting results per 1-µg/m3 increase in PM2.5, the results were recalculated as per 10-µg/m3 increase. we manually calculated the RRs for these two studies and transferred the RRs to estimate 10 µg/m3 increases in PM2.5. Automation tools were initially used to remove ineligible studies. Two reviewers independently screened the remaining records and retrieved reports. Twenty-six studies (28 datasets; 7,018,419 patients) were included. There was a significant association between PM2.5 and AeCOPD events on lag0 (eS = 1.01, 95\%Ci: 1.01-1.02, p {$<$} 0.001; i2=88.6\%, Pheterogeneity{$<$}0.001), lag1 (eS = 1.00, 95\%Ci: 1.00-1.01, p {$<$} 0.001; i2=82.5\%, Pheterogeneity{$<$}0.001), lag2 (eS = 1.01, 95\%Ci: 1.01-1.01, p {$<$} 0.001; i2=90.6\%, Pheterogeneity{$<$}0.001), lag3 (eS = 1.01, 95\%Ci: 1.00-1.01, p {$<$} 0.001; i2=88.9\%, Pheterogeneity{$<$}0.001), lag4 (eS = 1.00, 95\%Ci: 1.00-1.01, p {$<$} 0.001; i2=83.7\%, Pheterogeneity{$<$}0.001), and lag7 (eS = 1.00, 95\%Ci: 1.00-1.00, p {$<$} 0.001; i2=0.0\%, Pheterogeneity=0.743). The subgroup analyses showed that PM2.5 influenced the rates of hospitalization, emergency room visits, and outpatient visits. Similar trends were observed with PM10. The risk of AeCOPD events (hospitalization, emergency room visit, and outpatient visit) was significantly increased with a 10-µg/m3 increment in PM2.5 and PM10 from lag0 to lag7.},

  abstract = {Marine atmospheric aerosols play important roles in the global radiation balance and climate change. Hence, measuring physiochemical aerosol properties is essential to better understand their formation, aging processes, and source origins. However, high temporal resolution measurements of submicron particles are currently scarce in the northern South China Sea (SCS). In this study, we conducted a ship-based cruise campaign with a scanning mobility particle sizer and an online time of flight aerosol chemical speciation monitor to measure the particle number size distribution (PNSD) and the chemical composition of submicron particles over the northern SCS during summer 2018. The mean concentration of non-refractory submicron particulate matter (NR-PM1) was generally 9.11 ± 4.86 μg m 3; sulfate was the most abundant component, followed by organics, ammonium, nitrate, and chloride. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis was applied to the PNSD (size PMF) and organic aerosols (OA PMF) and further investigated the source apportionment of the submicron particles. The size PMF identified four factors, including ship exhaust, ship influencing marine primary, continent affected marine secondary, and mixed accumulation aerosols. The most abundant particles in the number concentration were associated with ship emissions, which accounted for approximately 44 \%. The submicron organic aerosols were highly oxidized and composed of low-volatility oxygenated OA (LV-OOA, 68 \%), semi-volatile OOA (SVOOA, 21 \%), and hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA, 11 \%). The backward trajectory of air masses showed that the northern SCS was most frequently (64.7 \%) influenced by air masses from the Indo-Chinese Peninsula (ICP) during the campaign, implying that pollutants from ICP have a significant impact on the atmosphere of the northern SCS during summer. Thus, in situ ship-based cruise measurements can provide valuable data on the physiochemical characteristics of marine atmospheric aerosols to better understand their source origins.},

This evaluation was achieved by using synthetic data sets that simulated environmental concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from the five following sources: petroleum refinery, vehicle exhaust, industrial coating, coal combustion, and natural gas. Hourly VOCs and speciated PM2.5 data were simulated for a one-week period. The PM2.5 data were further averaged every twelve hours to generate data sets with mixed temporal resolutions. The Multilinear Engine program was applied to resolve the source profiles and contributions. A series of sensitivity analyses was conducted to examine how uncertainties in the profile variation, measurement error, and source collinearity affected the model performance. The resolved factor profiles closely matched the input profiles, and the measurement error had a larger impact on the modeling results than the profile variation. In the most comprehensive data set that contained all three types of uncertainty, the R2 values between the input and retrieved source contributions were between 0.87 and 0.95. The estimated percentage contributions were also comparable with the input ones, demonstrating the applicability and validity of this improved model.},

In terms of risk prioritization, traffic/industry related factor was the major cause for benzene, ethylbenzene, Cr, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (29e69\%) while petrochemical related factor contributed most to the Ni risk (36\%).

One hundred and five samples were collected from three floor-levels at one building and analyzed for trace elements and nonpolar organic compounds (NPOCs). Seven source factors, i.e., industrial emission, biomass burning, PAH related, oil combustion, soil dust, traffic related, and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS)/lubricant, were retrieved by positive matrix factorization (PMF). The major contributors, including industrial emission (29\%), biomass burning (23\%), and oil combustion (22\%), could be involved with regional transported aerosols and showed non-significant variation in the vertical distribution. In contrast, both traffic related and ETS/lubricant factors could be the contributors to the statistically significant difference of PM2.5 concentrations between floor-levels.},

Particular marker compounds that carry signature information about different emission sources (i.e., gasoline or diesel motor vehicles, wood smoke, meat cooking, vegetative detritus, and cigarette smoke) are reviewed. Aerosol organic types (e.g., from mass spectrometry data, which can also help in elucidation of carbonaceous material sources) are also discussed.

  abstract = {Abstract. To gain insight into the spatial and chemical variation in submicron aerosol, a nationwide characterization of wintertime PM1 was performed using an aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM) and aethalometer at four representative sites across Ireland. Dublin, the capital city of Ireland, was the most polluted area with an average PM1 concentration of 8.6\,µg\,m−3, ranging from {$<$}\,0.5 to 146.8\,µg\,m−3 in December 2016. The PM1 in Dublin was mainly composed of carbonaceous aerosol (organic aerosol (OA) + black carbon (BC)), which, on average, accounted for 80\,\% of total PM1 mass during the monitoring period. Birr, a small town in the midlands area of Ireland with a population {$<$}\,1\,\% of that in Dublin, showed an average PM1 concentration (4.8\,µg\,m−3, ranging from {$<$}\,0.5 to 63.0\,µg\,m−3 in December 2015) of around half that (56\,\%) in Dublin. Similarly, the PM1 in Birr was also mainly composed of carbonaceous aerosol, accounting for 77\,\% of total PM1 mass. OA source apportionment results show that local emissions from residential heating were the dominant contributors (65\,\%–74\,\% of the OA) at the two sites, with solid fuel burning, on average, contributing 48\,\%–50\,\% of the total OA. On the other hand, Carnsore Point and Mace Head, which are both regional background coastal sites, showed lower average PM1 concentrations (2.2\,µg\,m−3 for Carnsore Point in December 2016 and 0.7\,µg\,m−3 for Mace Head in January 2013) due to the distance from emission sources. Both sites were dominated by secondary aerosol comprising oxygenated OA (OOA), nitrate, sulfate, and ammonium. This nationwide source apportionment study highlights the large contribution of residential solid fuel burning to urban air pollution and identifies specific sources that should be targeted to improve air quality. On the other hand, this study also shows that rural and coastal areas are dominated by secondary aerosol from regional transport, which is more difficult to tackle. Detailed characterization of the spatial and chemical variation in submicron aerosol in this relatively less studied western European region has significant implications for air quality policies and mitigation strategies, as well as for regional-transport aerosol modeling.},

The aim is to capture the spatio-temporal variability in people’s exposure to fine particles (PM2.5) and black carbon (BC) air pollution in Beijing, China. A total of 120 students were recruited for a panel study from ten universities in Haidian District in northwestern Beijing from December 2017 to June 2018. Real-time personal concentrations of PM2.5 and BC were measured over a 24-h period with two research-grade portable personal exposure monitors. Personal microenvironments (ME) location was assigned by applying an algorithm to the handheld GPS unit data. On average, the participants spent the most time indoors (79\% in Residence and 16\% in Workplace), and much less time travelling by Walking, Cycling, Bus and Metro. Similar patterns were observed across participant gender and body-mass index classifications. The participants were exposed to 33.8 ± 27.8 μg m-3 PM2.5 and to 1.9 ± 1.2 μg m-3 BC over the 24-h monitoring period, on average 24.3 μg m-3 (42\%) and 0.8 μg m-3 (28\%) lower, respectively, than the concurrent fixed-site ambient measurements. Relative differences between personal and ambient BC concentrations showed greater variability across the MEs, highlighting significant contributions from Dining and travelling by Bus, which involve potential combustion of fuels. This study demonstrates the potential value of personal exposure monitoring in investigating air pollution related health effects, and in evaluating the effectiveness of pollution control and intervention measures.},

  abstract = {Background: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a technique widely used in various fields, including artificial intelligence (AI), signal processing and bioinformatics. However existing algorithms and R packages cannot be applied to large matrices due to their slow convergence or to matrices with missing entries. Besides, most NMF research focuses only on blind decompositions: decomposition without utilizing prior knowledge. Finally, the lack of well-validated methodology for choosing the rank hyperparameters also raises concern on derived results. Results: We adopt the idea of sequential coordinate-wise descent to NMF to increase the convergence rate. We demonstrate that NMF can handle missing values naturally and this property leads to a novel method to determine the rank hyperparameter. Further, we demonstrate some novel applications of NMF and show how to use masking to inject prior knowledge and desirable properties to achieve a more meaningful decomposition. Conclusions: We show through complexity analysis and experiments that our implementation converges faster than well-known methods. We also show that using NMF for tumour content deconvolution can achieve results similar to existing methods like ISOpure. Our proposed missing value imputation is more accurate than conventional methods like multiple imputation and comparable to missForest while achieving significantly better computational efficiency. Finally, we argue that the suggested rank tuning method based on missing value imputation is theoretically superior to existing methods. All algorithms are implemented in the R package NNLM, which is freely available on CRAN and Github.},

  abstract = {To gain a comprehensive understanding of sources and health risks of trace elements in an area of China with high population densities and low PM2.5 concentrations, 15 trace elements (Al, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Sn, Ba, Pb) in PM2.5 were monitored from December 2020 to November 2021 in a representative city, Xiamen. The concentrations of trace elements in Xiamen displayed an obvious seasonal variation and were dominated by K, Fe, Al, Ca and Zn. Based on Positive Matrix Factorization analysis, source appointment revealed that the major sources of trace elements in Xiamen were traffic, dust, biomass and firework combustion, industrial manufacture and shipping emission. According to health risk assessment combined with the source appointment results, it indicated that the average noncarcinogenic risk was below the threshold and cancer risk of four hazardous metals (Cr, Ni, As, Pb) exceeded the threshold (10−6). Traffic-related source had almost half amount of contribution to the health risk induced by PM2.5-bound trace elements. During the dust transport period or Spring Festival period, the health risks exceeded an acceptable threshold even an order of magnitude higher, suggesting that the serious health risks still existed in low PM2.5 environment at certain times. Health risk assessment reminded that the health risk reduction in PM2.5 at southeastern China should prioritize traffic-related hazardous trace elements and highlighted the importance of controlling vehicles emissions in the future.},

  abstract = {Heze city, a medium-size city in Shandong province, Eastern China. Ambient PM2.5 samples were collected in urban area of Heze from August 2015 to April 2016, and chemical species and sources of PM2.5 were investigated in this paper. The results indicated that the average concentration of PM2.5 was 100.9 mg/m3 during the sampling period, and the water-soluble ions, carbonaceous species included elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC), as well as elements contributed 32.7e51.7\%, 16.3\% and 12.5\%, respectively, to PM2.5. Pearson's correlation analysis showed that the existing form of NH4þ was more complex and diverse in spring/summer, and ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate and ammonium hydrogen sulfate might be major form of NH4þ in autumn/winter. Correlation analysis between PM2.5 and SO42/NO3, PM2.5 and OC/EC during different seasons suggested that mobile sources might make an important impact on the increase of PM2.5 concentrations in spring/summer, and stationary sources might play a critical role on the increase of PM2.5 concentrations in autumn/winter. Seven factors were selected in Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) models analysis based on the Error Estimation (EE) diagnostics during different seasons. Secondary source had the highest contribution to PM2.5 in Heze for the whole year, and followed by coal combustion, vehicle exhaust, soil dust, construction dust, biomass burning and metal manufacturing, and their annual contributions to PM2.5 were 26.5\%, 17.2\%, 16.5\%, 11.5\%, 7.7\%, 7.0\% and 3.8\%, respectively. The air masses that were originated from Mongolia reflected the features of large-scale and long-distance air transport; while the air masses that began in Jiangsu, Shandong and Henan showed the features of small-scale and short-distance. Shandong, Henan and Jiangsu were identified as the major potential sources-areas of PM2.5 by using potential source contribution function (PSCF) and concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) models.},

  abstract = {Background: Oxidative stress and inflammation are considered to be important pathways leading to particulate matter (PM)-associated disease. In this exploratory study, we examined the effects of metals and oxidative potential (OP) in urban PM on biomarkers of systemic inflammation, oxidative stress and neural function. Methods: Fifty-three healthy non-smoking volunteers (mean age 28 years, twenty-eight females) were exposed to coarse (2.5–10 μm, mean 213 μg/m3), fine (0.15–2.5 μm, 238 μg/m3), and/or ultrafine concentrated ambient PM ({$<$} 0.3 μm, 136 μg/m3). Exposures lasted 130 min, separated by ≥2 weeks. Metal concentrations and OP (measured by ascorbate and glutathione depletion in synthetic airway fluid) in PM were analyzed. Blood and urine samples were collected pre-exposure, and 1-h and 21-h post exposure for assessment of biomarkers. We used mixed-regression models to analyze associations adjusting for PM size and mass concentration. Results: Results for metals were expressed as change (\%) from daily pre-exposure biomarker levels after exposure to a metal at a level equivalent to the mean concentration. Exposure to various metals (silver, aluminum, barium, copper, iron, potassium, lithium, nickel, tin, and/or vanadium) was significantly associated with increased levels of various blood or urinary biomarkers. For example, the blood inflammatory marker vascular endothelia growth factor (VEGF) increased 5.3\% (95\% confidence interval: 0.3\%, 10.2\%) 1-h post exposure to nickel; the traumatic brain injury marker ubiquitin Cterminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) increased 11\% (1.2\%, 21\%) and 14\% (0.3\%, 29\%) 1-h and 21-h post exposure to barium, respectively; and the systemic stress marker cortisol increased 1.5\% (0\%, 2.9\%) and 1.5\% (0.5\%, 2.8\%) 1-h and 21-h post exposure to silver, respectively. Urinary DNA oxidation marker 8‑hydroxy‑deoxy‑guanosine increased 14\% (6.4\%, 21\%) 1-h post exposure to copper; urinary neural marker vanillylmandelic acid increased 29\% (3\%, 54\%) 1-h post exposure to aluminum; and urinary cortisol increased 88\% (0.9\%, 176\%) 1-h post exposure to vanadium. Results for OP were expressed as change (\%) from daily pre-exposure biomarker levels after exposure to ascorbate-related OP at a level equivalent to the mean concentration, or for exposure to glutathione-related OP at a level above the limit of detection. Exposure to ascorbate- or glutathione-related OP was significantly associated with increased inflammatory and neural biomarkers including interleukin-6, VEGF, UCHL1, and S100 calcium-binding protein B in blood, and malondialdehyde and 8-hydroxy-deoxy-guanosine in urine. For example, UCHL1 increased 9.4\% (1.8\%, 17\%) in blood 21-h post exposure to ascorbate-related OP, while urinary malondialdehyde increased 19\% (3.6\%, 35\%) and 8-hydroxydeoxy-guanosine increased 24\% (2.9\%, 48\%) 21-h post exposure to ascorbate- and glutathione-related OP, respectively. Conclusion: Our results from this exploratory study suggest that metal constituents and OP in ambient PM may influence biomarker levels associated with systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, perturbations of neural function, and systemic physiological stress.},

  abstract = {Emissions of air pollutants from primary and secondary sources in China are considerably higher than those in developed countries, and exposure to air pollution is main risk of public health. Identifying specific particulate matter (PM) compositions and sources are essential for policy makers to propose effective control measures for pollutant emissions. Ambient PM2.5 samples covered a whole year were collected from three coastal cities of the Bohai Sea. Oxidative potential (OP) was selected as the indicator to characterize associated PM compositions and sources most responsible for adverse impacts on human health. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) and multiple linear regression (MLR) were employed to estimate correlations of PM2.5 sources with OP. The volume- and mass-based dithiothreitol (DTTv and DTTm) activities of PM2.5 were significantly higher in local winter or autumn (p {$<$} 0.01). Spatial and seasonal variations in DTTv and DTTm were much larger than mass concentrations of PM2.5, indicated specific chemical components are responsible for PM2.5 derived OP. Strong correlations (r {$>$} 0.700, p {$<$} 0.01) were found between DTT activity and water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) and some transition metals. Using PMF, source fractions of PM2.5 were resolved as secondary source, traffic source, biomass burning, sea spray and urban dust, industry, coal combustion, and mineral dust. Further quantified by MLR, coal combustion, biomass burning, secondary sources, industry, and traffic source were dominant contributors to the water-soluble DTTv activity. Our results also suggested large differences in seasonal contributions of different sources to DTTv variability. A higher contribution of DTTv was derived from coal combustion during the local heating period. Secondary sources exhibited a greater fraction of DTTv in summer, when there was stronger solar radiation. Traffic sources exhibited a prevailing contribution in summer, and industry contributed larger proportions in spring and winter. Future abatement priority of air pollution should reduce the sources contributing to OP of PM2.5. Chemical compositions of PM2.5 regulated DTT-based OP, and the mass concentration and DTT activity of PM2.5, exhibited different emission sources characteristics.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Beijing has suffered from heavy local emissions as well as regional transport of air pollutants, resulting in severe atmospheric fine-particle (PM2.5) pollution. This study developed a combined method to investigate source types of PM2.5 and its source regions during winter 2016 in Beijing, which include the receptor model (positive matrix factorization, PMF), footprint and an air quality model. The PMF model was performed with high-time-resolution measurements of trace elements, water soluble ions, organic carbon and elemental carbon using online instruments during the wintertime campaign of the Air Pollution and Human Health in a Chinese Megacity – Beijing (APHH-Beijing) program in 2016. Source types and their contributions estimated by PMF model using online measurements were linked with source regions identified by the footprint model, and the regional transport contribution was estimated by an air quality model (the Nested Air Quality Prediction Model System, NAQPMS) to analyze the specific sources and source regions during haze episodes. Our results show that secondary and biomass-burning sources were dominated by regional transport, while the coal combustion source increased with local contribution, suggesting that strict control strategies for local coal combustion in Beijing and a reduction of biomass-burning and gaseous precursor emissions in surrounding areas were essential to improve air quality in Beijing. The combination of PMF with footprint results revealed that secondary sources were mainly associated with southern footprints (53\,\%). The northern footprint was characterized by a high dust source contribution (11\,\%), while industrial sources increased with the eastern footprint (10\,\%). The results demonstrated the power of combining receptor model-based source apportionment with other models in understanding the formation of haze episodes and identifying specific sources from different source regions affecting air quality in Beijing.},

PM2.5 aerosol samples were collected for 2 days in a week at 12 h interval in a day, both in dry and wet seasons, on ZefluorTM filter papers using Thermo-Electron Corporation Reference Ambient Air Sampler (RAAS). Total 310 samples were collected during the period under study, i.e., from November 2005 to December 2007. High PM2.5 loads were observed in winter, which were approximately 4 times greater than those observed in the summer, spring, fall and monsoon seasons in the yearlong measurements. Source apportionment was performed on short duration analysis results of November 2005 to March 2006 using Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model. The results derived from PMF model indicated that the major contributors to PM2.5 in Lahore are: soil/road dust, industrial emissions, vehicular emissions and secondary aerosols. It is, therefore, concluded that in addition to local vehicular and industrial emissions, the city is also affected from trans-boundary air pollutants particularly due to secondary aerosols (especially SO4 2-) during winter which increase PM2.5 concentrations manifold when relatively less mixing height exists. The sulfate particles also facilitate in haze/fog formation during calm highly humid conditions, thus reduce visibility and increase the incidents of respiratory diseases encountered in the city every year.},

  abstract = {Air pollution is associated with increased cardiovascular and pulmonary morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms of air pollution-induced health effects involve oxidative stress and inflammation. As a matter of fact, particulate matter (PM), especially fine (PM2.5, PM2.5m) and ultrafine (PM0.1, PM0.1m) particles, ozone, nitrogen oxides, and transition metals, are potent oxidants or able to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). Oxidative stress can trigger redox-sensitive pathways that lead to different biological processes such as inflammation and cell death. However, it does appear that the susceptibility of target organ to oxidative injury also depends upon its ability to upregulate protective scavenging systems. As vehicular traffic is known to importantly contribute to PM exposure, its intensity and quality must be strongly relevant determinants of the qualitative characteristics of PM spread in the atmosphere. Change in the composition of this PM is likely to modify its health impact. © 2011 Maura Lodovici and Elisabetta Bigagli.},

  abstract = {The molecular marker-based chemical mass balance (MM-CMB) method performs well in the source apportionment of organic carbon (OC) but has some difficulty with contributions from primary sources to inorganic secondary ions when apportioning PM2.5 (particles with aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 mm or less) sources. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) with the input of inorganic and organic tracers can properly estimate the contributions of primary and secondary sources to inorganic secondary ions; however, PMF is unable to apportion several PM2.5 sources with large fractions of organic carbon and few elemental compositions. In this study regarding data collected in 2011 and 2012 at three sites in Wuhan, China, the MM-CMB model was used to apportion OC in the PM2.5, and the PMF model was used to apportion the inorganic ions (sulfate, nitrate, and ammonia), dust, and EC. The source contributions of PM2.5 were estimated by reconstructing masses of bulk chemical components that had been apportioned to real-world sources using suitable source apportionment methods. Good performance of this hybrid source apportionment strategy was observed with ten resolved factors, explaining 70e80\% of measured PM2.5 mass on average. The hybrid strategy takes the advantages of both models in PM2.5 source apportionment and yields unique source apportionment results for PM2.5 bulk chemical components, which could provide new information for optimizing air quality regulations for the emission abatement of target PM mass and compositions for countries around the world.},

Here, we improve the interpretability of tree-based models through three main contributions: 1) The first polynomial time algorithm to compute optimal explanations based on game theory. 2) A new type of explanation that directly measures local feature interaction effects. 3) A new set of tools for understanding global model structure based on combining many local explanations of each prediction. We apply these tools to three medical machine learning problems and show how combining many high-quality local explanations allows us to represent global structure while retaining local faithfulness to the original model. These tools enable us to i) identify high magnitude but low frequency non-linear mortality risk factors in the US population, ii) highlight distinct population sub-groups with shared risk characteristics, iii) identify non-linear interaction effects among risk factors for chronic kidney disease, and iv) monitor a machine learning model deployed in a hospital by identifying which features are degrading the model’s performance over time. Given the popularity of tree-based machine learning models, these improvements to their interpretability have implications across a broad set of domains.},

  abstract = {In humans, studies based on Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) concept and targeting short half-lived chemicals, including many endocrine disruptors, generally assessed exposures from spot biospecimens. Effects of early-life exposure to atmospheric pollutants were reported, based on outdoor air pollution levels. For both exposure families, exposure misclassification is expected from these designs: for non-persistent chemicals, because a spot biospecimen is unlikely to capture exposure over windows longer than a few days; for air pollutants, because indoor levels are ignored. We developed a couple-child cohort relying on deep phenotyping and extended personal exposure assessment aiming to better characterize the effects of components of the exposome, including air pollutants and non-persistent endocrine disruptors, on child health and development. Pregnant women were included in SEPAGES couple-child cohort (Grenoble area) from 2014 to 2017. Maternal and children exposure to air pollutants was repeatedly assessed by personal monitors. DNA, RNA, serum, plasma, placenta, cord blood, meconium, child and mother stools, living cells, milk, hair and repeated urine samples were collected. A total of 484 pregnant women were recruited, with excellent compliance to the repeated urine sampling protocol (median, 43 urine samples per woman during pregnancy). The main health outcomes are child respiratory health using early objective measures, growth and neurodevelopment. Compared to former studies, the accuracy of assessment of non-persistent exposures is expected to be strongly improved in this new type of birth cohort tailored for the exposome concept, with deep phenotyping and extended exposure characterization. By targeting weaknesses in exposure assessment of the current approaches of cohorts on effects of early life environmental exposures with strong temporal variations, and relying on a rich biobank to provide insight on the underlying biological pathways whereby exposures affect health, this design is expected to provide deeper understanding of the interplay between the Exposome and child development and health.},

In this study, we investigated the single-particle characteristics and aging of cooking aerosols in Beijing during winter based on single-particle mass spectrometry measurements. The mixing state of cooking particles showed that molecular tracers (i.e., palmitic acid, linoleic acid, and oleic acid) mixed with inorganics (sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium) and carbonaceous species in the atmosphere, indicating that they had experienced aging. Cooking aerosols contributed more to particulate matter during clean periods than during polluted periods. The size distribution of cooking particles showed a bimodal pattern with a higher degree of aging of larger particles. In addition, we found high azelaic acid/oleic acid ratios in oleic acid-containing particles usually occurred under high O3 concentrations, and the ratio of azelaic acid to oleic acid peaked in the afternoon following the peak of the O3 concentration, indicating ozonolysis of oleic acid to form azelaic acid. Furthermore, oleic acid was found to age faster during clean periods with higher O3 concentrations. Our results can help in the assessment of the impact of cooking aerosols on air quality, human health, and climate.},

The sites were in Antwerpen, Gent, Brugge, and Oostende. The PM10 mass concentration was determined by weighing; organic and elemental carbon (OC and EC) were measured by thermal-optical analysis, the wood burning tracers levoglucosan, mannosan and galactosan were determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, 8 water-soluble ions were measured by ion chromatography, and 15 elements were determined by a combination of inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry and mass spectrometry. The multi-species dataset was subjected to receptor modeling by PMF. The 10 retained factors (with their overall average percentage contributions to the experimental PM10 mass) were wood burning (9.5\%), secondary nitrate (24\%), secondary sulfate (12.6\%), sea salt (10.0\%), aged sea salt (19.2\%), crustal matter (9.7\%), non-ferrous metals (1.81\%), traffic (10.3\%), non-exhaust traffic (0.52\%), and heavy oil burning (3.0\%). The average contributions of wood smoke for the four sites were quite substantial in winter and ranged from 12.5 to 20\% for the PM10 mass and from 47 to 64\% for PM10 OC. Wood burning appeared to be also a notable source of As, Cd, and Pb. The contribution from wood burning to the PM10 mass and OC was also assessed by making use of levoglucosan as single marker compound and the conversion factors of Schmidl et al. (2008), as done in our previous study on wood burning in Flanders (Maenhaut et al., 2012). However, the apportionments were much lower than those deduced from PMF. It seems that the conversion factors of Schmidl et al. (2008) may not be applicable to wood burning in Flanders. From scatter plots of the PMF-derived wood smoke OC and PM versus levoglucosan, we arrived at conversion factors of 9.7 and 22.6, respectively.},

  abstract = {Particulate matter (PM) is an important constituent of atmospheric pollution especially in areas under the influence of industrial emissions. Megalopolis is a small city of 10,000 inhabitants located in central Peloponnese in close proximity to three coal opencast mines and two lignite fired power plants. 50 PM10 samples were collected in Megalopolis during the years 2009–11 for elemental and multivariate analysis. For the elemental analysis PIXE was used as one of the most effective techniques in APM analytical characterization. Altogether, the concentrations of 22 elements (Z = 11–33), whereas Black Carbon was also determined for each sample using a reflectometer. Factorization software was used (EPA PMF 3.0) for source apportionment analysis. The analysis revealed that major emission sources were soil dust 33\% (7.94 ± 0.27 lg/m3), biomass burning 19\% (4.43 ± 0.27 lg/m3), road dust 15\% (3.63 ± 0.37 lg/m3), power plant emissions 13\% (3.01 ± 0.44 lg/m3), traffic 12\% (2.82 ± 0.37 lg/m3), and sea spray 8\% (1.99 ± 0.41 lg/m3). Wind trajectories have suggested that metals associated with emission from the power plants came mainly from west and were connected with the locations of the lignite mines located in this area. Soil resuspension, road dust and power plant emissions increased during the warm season of the year, while traffic/secondary, sea spray and biomass burning become dominant during the cold season.},

This work is demonstrating how a source apportionment study utilizing PMF 5.0 enhanced diagnostic tools can achieve an improved solution with documented levels of uncertainty for such a dataset. The uncertainty of the solution is rarely reported in source apportionment studies or it is reported partially. Reporting the uncertainty of the solution is very important especially in the case of small datasets. PM2.5 samples collected in Patras during the year 2011 were used. The concentrations of 22 elements (Z~=~11–33) were determined using PIXE. Source apportionment analysis revealed that PM2.5 emission sources were biomass burning (11\%), sea salt (8\%), shipping emissions (10\%), vehicle emissions (33\%), mineral dust (2\%) and secondary sulfates (33\%) while unaccounted mass was 3\%. Although Patras city center is located in a very close proximity to the city's harbor, the contribution of shipping originating emissions was never before quantified. As rotational stability is hard to be achieved when a small dataset is used the rotational stability of the solution was thoroughly evaluated. A number of constraints were applied to the solution in order to reduce rotational ambiguity.},

  abstract = {Source emissions with high covariance degrade the performance of multivariate models, and often highly-time resolved data is needed to accurately extract the contribution of different emissions. Here, we use highly time-resolved size segregated elemental composition data to apportion the sources of the elemental fraction of PM in Zürich (May 2019–May 2020). For data collection, we have used an ambient metals monitor, Xact 625i, equipped with a sampling inlet alternating between PM2.5 and PM10. By implementing interpolation and a newly proposed uncertainty estimation methodology, it was possible to obtain and use in PMF a combined dataset of PM2.5 and PMcoarse (PM10-2.5) having data from only one instrument. The combination of the inlet switching system, the instrument’s high time resolution, and the use of advanced source apportionment approaches yielded improved source apportionment results in terms of the number of identified sources, as the model, additionally to the diurnal and seasonal variation of the dataset, also utilizes the variation from the size segregated data. Thirteen sources of elements were identified, i.e., sea salt (5.4\%), biomass burning (7.2\%), construction (4.3\%), industrial (3.3\%), light-duty vehicles (5.4\%), Pb (0.7\%), Zn (0.7\%), dust (22.1\%), transported dust (9.5\%), sulfates (15.4\%), heavy-duty vehicles (17\%), railway (6.6\%) and fireworks (2.4\%). The Covid-19 lockdown effect in PM sources in the area was also quantified. High-intensity events disproportionally affect the PMF solution, and in many cases, they are getting discarded before analysis, removing thus valuable information from the dataset. In this study, a three-step source apportionment approach was used to get a well-resolved unmixed solution when firework data points were included in the analysis. This approach can also be used for other sources and/or events with very high contributions that distort source apportionment analysis. Optimized source apportionment techniques are necessary for effective air pollution monitoring.},

  abstract = {Air pollution, particularly from particulate matter (PM), poses serious public health and environmental risks, especially in urban areas. To address this, accurate source apportionment (SA) of PM is essential for effective air quality 15 management. Traditional SA approaches often rely on offline data collection, limiting timely responses to pollution events. SA applied on data from online techniques, especially with high temporal resolution is advantageous over offline techniques, enabling the study of the diurnal variability of emission sources and also the study of specific events. Recent technological advancements now enable real-time SA, allowing continuous, detailed analysis of pollution sources. This study presents the first application of the ACSM-Xact-Aethalometer (AXA) setup combined with SoFi RT software for real-time source 20 apportionment (RT-SA) of PM in Athens, Greece. The AXA setup integrates chemical, elemental, and black carbon data streams, covering a broad spectrum of PM components and capturing a comprehensive representation of PM sources in an urban environment. The results demonstrate that traffic-related emissions are the largest contributors to PM, with significant contributions from secondary species such as sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and secondary organic aerosols, which together accounted for approximately 57\% of the PM mass. Primary sources such as biomass burning and cooking contributed around 25 10\% each, with natural sources like dust and sea salt comprising the remainder. The SoFi RT software is employed for continuous SA, offering automated analysis of PM sources in near real-time (minutes after the measurements). Our findings demonstrate that this setup effectively identifies major pollution sources. This work underscores the AXA system's potential for advancing urban air quality monitoring and informs targeted interventions to reduce PM pollution.},

The study approach combines i) spatio-temporal correlation analysis between in situ aerosol data measured in April 2016 at Capo Granitola (southern Sicily), and high-resolution ocean color composites, ii) back-trajectory analysis, and iii) potential source contribution function (PSCF) algorithm. The southwestern Mediterranean region (between Sardinia and the Algerian coast) was identified as the most probable dimethylsulfide (DMS) source region contributing to the observed MSA concentrations. Conversely, the blooming northwestern Mediterranean Sea region did not appear to contribute significantly. The present analysis shows that the reasons may be biotic (phytoplankton type, stress level) or abiotic (sea surface temperature), or a combination of both. We also postulate that the identified source region is associated with the production of non-sea-salt-sulfate and secondary organic aerosols from the processing of sea-released volatile organic compounds.},

Together they host a growing population of around 1.8 million people. The air quality in this conurbation is strongly influenced by urbanization. However, there are no comprehensive studies that have assessed the sources of air pollution and their impacts on health. Despite being neighboring cities, the drastic change in altitude and topography between La Paz and El Alto together with different socio-economic activities lead to different sources, dynamics and transport of particulate matter (PM). In this investigation, PM10 samples were collected at two urban background stations located in La Paz and El Alto between April 2016 and June 2017. The samples were later analyzed for a wide range of chemical species including numerous source tracers (OC, EC, water-soluble ions, sugar anhydrides, sugar alcohols, trace metals, and molecular organic species). The US-EPA Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF v.5.0) receptor model was then applied for source apportionment of PM10. This is the first source apportionment study in South America that incorporates a large set of organic markers (such as levoglucosan, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons – PAH, hopanes and alkanes) together with inorganic species. The multisite PMF resolved 11 main sources of PM. The largest annual contribution to PM10 came from two major sources: the ensemble of the four vehicular emissions sources (exhaust and non-exhaust), together responsible for 35 \% and 25 \% of the measured PM in La Paz and El Alto, respectively, and dust contributing 20 \% and 32 \% to the total. Secondary aerosols contributed 22 \% (24 \%) in La Paz (El Alto). Agriculture-related smoke from biomass burning originated in the Bolivian lowlands and neighboring countries contributed to 8 \% (7 \%) of the total PM10 mass annually. This contribution increased to 17 \% (13 \%) between August–October. Primary biogenic emissions were responsible for 13 \% (7 \%) of the measured PM10 mass. Finally, it was possible to identify a profile related to open waste burning occurring between the months of May and August. Despite the fact that this source contributed only to 2 \% (5 \%) of the total PM10 mass, it constitutes the second largest source of PAHs, compounds potentially hazardous to health. Our analysis resulted in the identification of two specific traffic-related sources. In addition, we also identified a lubricant source (not frequently identified) and a non-exhaust emissions source. This study shows that PM10 concentrations in La Paz and El Alto region are mostly impacted by a limited number of local sources. In conclusion, dust, traffic emissions, open waste burning and biomass burning are the main sources to target in order to improve air quality in both cities.},

  abstract = {Abstract. La Paz and El Alto are two fast-growing, high-altitude Bolivian cities forming the second-largest metropolitan area in the country. Located between 3200~and 4050\,m\,a.s.l. (above sea level), these cities are home to a burgeoning population of approximately 1.8 million residents. The air quality in this conurbation is heavily influenced by urbanization; however, there are no comprehensive studies evaluating the sources of air pollution and their health impacts. Despite their proximity, the substantial variation in altitude, topography, and socioeconomic activities between La Paz and El Alto result in distinct sources, dynamics, and transport of particulate matter (PM). In this investigation, PM10 samples were collected at two urban background stations located in La Paz and El Alto between April~2016 and June~2017. The samples were later analyzed for a wide range of chemical species including numerous source tracers (OC, EC, water-soluble ions, sugar anhydrides, sugar alcohols, trace metals, and molecular organic species). The United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF~v.5.0) receptor model was employed for the source apportionment of PM10. This is one of the first source apportionment studies in South America that incorporates an extensive suite of organic markers, including levoglucosan, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), hopanes, and alkanes, alongside inorganic species. The multisite PMF resolved 11~main sources of PM. The largest annual contribution to PM10 came from the following two major sources: the ensemble of the four vehicular emissions sources (exhaust and non-exhaust), accountable for 35\,\% and 25\,\% of the measured PM in La Paz and El Alto, respectively; and dust, which contributed 20\,\% and 32\,\% to the total PM mass. Secondary aerosols accounted for 22\,\% (24\,\%) in La Paz (El Alto). Agricultural smoke resulting from biomass burning in the Bolivian lowlands and neighboring countries contributed to 9\,\% (8\,\%) of the total PM10 mass annually, increasing to 17\,\% (13\,\%) between August–October. Primary biogenic emissions were responsible for 13\,\% (7\,\%) of the measured PM10 mass. Additionally, a profile associated with open waste burning occurring from May to August was identified. Although this source contributed only to 2\,\% (5\,\%) of the total PM10 mass, it constitutes the second largest source of PAHs, which are compounds potentially hazardous to human health. Our analysis additionally resolved two different traffic-related factors, a lubricant source (not frequently identified), and a non-exhaust emissions source. Overall, this study demonstrates that PM10 concentrations in La Paz and El Alto region are predominantly influenced by a limited number of local sources. In conclusion, to improve air quality in both cities, efforts should primarily focus on addressing dust, traffic emissions, open waste burning, and biomass burning.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric aerosols in the PM10 fraction have been simultaneously sampled at three sites in the Genoa urban and suburban area during the second half of 2005, and information on the elemental composition has been gathered through energy dispersive Xray fluorescence. Thanks to the simultaneous measurements and wind information, a few aerosol transport and transformation processes originated from the nearby sea and in the neighbouring Po Valley have been described. Sea salt concentrations at the three sites were well correlated and often related to Southern sector winds; moreover, by examining the Cl/Na ratio at two sites the time scale for Cl depletion in particulate matter has been estimated as 1–1.5 h for the Genoa atmosphere. During a Northerly gale, excess elemental Si concentrations (peaking more than 4 μg m−3) were found at two sites, and were ascribed to an unknown local source. Finally, during an 11-day long ‘heat wave’ large concentrations for total PM10, dust and secondary compounds have been found; these large concentrations lead to a number of exceedances of air quality standards, and have been ascribed to advection from the Po Valley.},

Neuropsychological testing is a key element in the diagnostic procedures of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), but has presently a limited value in the prediction of progression to dementia. We advance the hypothesis that newer statistical classification methods derived from data mining and machine learning methods like Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines and Random Forests can improve accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of predictions obtained from neuropsychological testing. Seven non parametric classifiers derived from data mining methods (Multilayer Perceptrons Neural Networks, Radial Basis Function Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, CART, CHAID and QUEST Classification Trees and Random Forests) were compared to three traditional classifiers (Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis and Logistic Regression) in terms of overall classification accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, Area under the ROC curve and Press’Q. Model predictors were 10 neuropsychological tests currently used in the diagnosis of dementia. Statistical distributions of classification parameters obtained from a 5-fold cross-validation were compared using the Friedman’s nonparametric test.}

  abstract = {Background: Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been found to be detrimental to respiratory health of children, but few studies have examined the effects of prenatal PM2:5 oxidative potential (OP) on lung function in infants and preschool children. Objectives: We estimated the associations of personal exposure to PM2:5 and OP during pregnancy on offspring objective lung function parameters and compared the strengths of associations between both exposure metrics. Methods: We used data from 356 mother-child pairs from the SEPAGES cohort. PM filters collected twice during a week were analyzed for OP, using the dithiothreitol (DTT) and the ascorbic acid (AA) assays, quantifying the exposure of each pregnant woman. Lung function was assessed with tidal breathing analysis (TBFVL) and nitrogen multiple-breath washout (N2MBW) test, performed at 6 wk, and airwave oscillometry (AOS) performed at 3 y. Associations of prenatal PM2:5 mass and OP with lung function parameters were estimated using multiple linear regressions. Results: In neonates, an interquartile (IQR) increase in OPvDTT (0.89 nmol/min/m3) was associated with a decrease in functional residual capacity (FRC) measured by N2MBW [ß = - 2.26 mL; 95\% confidence interval (CI): -4.68, 0.15]. Associations with PM2:5 showed similar patterns in comparison with OPvDTT but of smaller magnitude. Lung clearance index (LCI) and TBFVL parameters did not show any clear association with the exposures considered. At 3 y, increased frequency-dependent resistance of the lungs (Rrs7-19) from AOS tended to be associated with higher OPvDTT(ß = 0.09hPa×s/L; 95\% CI: -0.06, 0.24) and OPVAA (IQR = 1.14 nmol/min/m3; ß = 0.12hPa× s/L; 95\% CI: -0.04, 0.27) but not with PM2:5(lQR = 6.9 lg/m3; ß = 0.02hPa× s/L; 95\% CI: -0.13, 0.16). Results for FRC and Rrs7-19 remained similar in OP models adjusted on PM25. Discussion: Prenatal exposure to OPvDTT was associated with several offspring lung function parameters over time, all related to lung volumes.}

One-week personal measurements of exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of ≤ 2.5 µm mass concentration (PM2.5) and PM2.5 oxidative potential (OP) were assessed in 270 pregnant women from the French cohort SEPAGES. PM filters were analyzed for PM2.5 OP using the dithiothreitol (DTT) and the ascorbic acid (AA) assays. From a blood sample withdrawn at the end of the exposure measurement week, levels of 29 cytokines and chemokines were measured at baseline and after T cell and dendritic cell activation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and resiquimod (R848), respectively. Associations between each air pollutant and each cytokine were assessed using adjusted linear regression models. An increase in NO2 exposure was associated with higher interleukin 10 (IL-10) and lower PHA-activated tumor necrosis factor (TNF). No association with PM2.5 concentration was observed, but increased exposure to PM OPAA was associated with lower baseline and R848activated IL-8 and increased exposure to PM OPDTT was associated with higher PHA-activated IL-17A. Our study provides insights into the relationships between air pollution exposure and immune function among pregnant women.},

  abstract = {PM10 samples collected over one year from the city of Sosnowiec, part of the Upper Silesia metropolis were studied. The locale was a gradient meteorological station, 4 m and 100 m above ground. The dominant compounds identified were anhydro-, mono- and disaccharides which were divided into three groups of organic tracers (OT): biomass burning (BB) including low-rank coal burning, pollen grains (PG) and fungal spores (FS). The BB group included: levoglucosan, mannosan and galactosan, complemented with vanillic and dehydroabietic acids. The PG group included: fructose, glucose and sucrose, supplemented with D-pinitol, and the FS tracers included: arabitol, mannitol and trehalose. Levoglucosan reached 1503 ng/m3 in heating season at 4 m and 983 ng/m3 at 100 m. These values are among the highest mean concentrations of levoglucosan reported in Europe, confirming severe pollution of the Upper Silesian urban environment. We also suggest that the significant levoglucosan levels during the non-heating seasons could be from wind advected polluted soil and dust. All FS tracers correlate well with fungal spore counts, while the correlation of pollen numbers with their typical molecular tracers is statistically less significant. Weather conditions significantly influence the concentration of OT in aerosols. Among these, air temperature is a factor that affects the occurrence/existence of OT in the atmosphere, while temperature inversions are the main phenomenon which determines elevated concentrations of pollutants and their vertical variation in ambient air. For example, the concentration of BB tracers can be twice as high at 4 m as at 100 m under moderate to strong temperature inversions associated with low wind speed. Water vapor pressure and sun irradiation are also important factors controlling OT concentrations. This is one of the first studies of vertical differences in organic tracers which presents the variability and complexity of the processes affecting their concentrations in ambient air.},

In this study, we evaluated the spatial and size distribution of OP results obtained by three OP assays (OPAA, OPDCFH and OPDTT), to qualitative identify the relative relevance of single source contributions in building up OP values and to map the PM potential to induce oxidative stress in living organisms. To this aim, AA, DCFH and DTT assays were applied to size-segregated PM samples, collected by low-pressure cascade impactors, and to PM10 samples collected at 23 different sampling sites (about 1 km between each other) in Terni, an urban and industrial hot-spot of Central Italy, by using recently developed high spatial resolution samplers of PM, which worked in parallel during three monitoring periods (February, April and December 2017). The sampling sites were chosen for representing the main spatially disaggregated sources of PM (vehicular traffic, rail network, domestic heating, power plant for waste treatment, steel plant) present in the study area. The obtained results clearly showed a very different sensitivity of the three assays toward each local PM source. OPAA was particularly sensitive toward coarse particles released from the railway, OPDCFH was sensible to fine particles released from the steel plant and domestic biomass heating, and OPDTT was quite selectively sensitive toward the fine fraction of PM released by industrial and biomass burning sources.},

All methods were applied to a data set that gauged eye-movements during reading and offline comprehension in the context of multiple ability measures with high collinearity due to their shared verbal core.

The concentration ratios of C2 =C4, diacid-C =OC and C2 = total diacids are larger in the daytime than in the nighttime, suggesting that the daytime aerosols are more photochemically aged than those in the nighttime due to the higher temperature and stronger solar radiation. Both ratios of C2 = C4 (R2 {$>$} 0:5) and C3 = C4 (R2 {$>$} 0:5) correlated strongly with the ambient temperatures, indicating that SOA in the mountaintop atmosphere are mainly derived from the photochemical oxidation of local emissions rather than long-range transport. The mass ratios of azelaic acid to adipic acid (C9 =C6), azelaic acid to phthalic aid (C9 = Ph) and glyoxal to methylglyoxal (Gly = mGly) and the strong linear correlations of major dicarboxylic acids and related SOA (i.e., C2, C3, C4, !C2, Pyr, Gly and mGly) with biogenic precursors (SOA tracers derived from isoprene, α/β-pinene and β-caryophyllene) further suggest that aerosols in this region are mainly originated from biogenic sources (i.e., tree emissions). C2 concentrations correlated well with aerosol pH, indicating that particle acidity favors the organic acid formation. The stable carbon isotopic compositions (δ13C) of the dicarboxylic acids are higher in the daytime than in the nighttime, with the highest value (-16:5±1:9 \%) found for C2 and the lowest value (-25:2±2:7 \%) found for C9. An increase in δ13C values of C2 along with increases in C2 = Gly and C2 = mGly ratios was observed, largely due to the isotopic fractionation effect during the precursor oxidation process.},

  abstract = {Handling missing values is a crucial step in preprocessing data in Machine Learning. Most available algorithms for analyzing datasets in the feature selection process and classification or estimation process analyze complete datasets. Consequently, in many cases, the strategy for dealing with missing values is to use only instances with full data or to replace missing values with a mean, mode, median, or a constant value. Usually, discarding missing samples or replacing missing values by means of fundamental techniques causes bias in subsequent analyzes on datasets. Aim: Demonstrate the positive impact of multivariate imputation in the feature selection process on datasets with missing values. Results: We compared the effects of the feature selection process using complete datasets, incomplete datasets with missingness rates between 5 and 50\%, and imputed datasets by basic techniques and multivariate imputation. The feature selection algorithms used are well-known methods. The results showed that the datasets imputed by multivariate imputation obtained the best results in feature selection compared to datasets imputed by basic techniques or non-imputed incomplete datasets. Conclusions: Considering the results obtained in the evaluation, applying multivariate imputation by MICE reduces bias in the feature selection process.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to fine particulate air pollution is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We previously demonstrated that exposure to dilute diesel exhaust causes vascular dysfunction in humans. OBJECTIVES: We conducted a study to determine whether exposure to ambient particulate matter causes vascular dysfunction. METHODS: Twelve male patients with stable coronary heart disease and 12 age-matched volunteers were exposed to concentrated ambient fine and ultrafine particles (CAPs) or filtered air for 2 hr using a randomized, double-blind cross-over study design. We measured peripheral vascular vasomotor and fibrinolytic function, and inflammatory variables—including circulating leukocytes, serum C-reactive protein, and exhaled breath 8-isoprostane and nitrotyrosine—6–8 hr after both exposures. RESULTS: Particulate concentrations (mean ± SE) in the exposure chamber (190 ± 37 µg/m3) were higher than ambient levels (31 ± 8 µg/m3) and levels in filtered air (0.5 ± 0.4 µg/m3; p {$<$} 0.001). Chemical analysis of CAPs identified low levels of elemental carbon. Exhaled breath 8-isoprostane concentrations increased after exposure to CAPs (16.9 ± 8.5 vs. 4.9 ± 1.2 pg/mL, p {$<$} 0.05), but markers of systemic inflammation were largely unchanged. Although there was a dose-dependent increase in blood flow and plasma tissue plasminogen activator release (p {$<$} 0.001 for all), CAPs exposure had no effect on vascular function in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Despite achieving marked increases in particulate matter, exposure to CAPs—low in combustion-derived particles—did not affect vasomotor or fibrinolytic function in either middleaged healthy volunteers or patients with coronary heart disease. These findings contrast with previous exposures to dilute diesel exhaust and highlight the importance of particle composition in determining the vascular effects of particulate matter in humans.},

  abstract = {Trace and major elements concentrations in PM10 and PM2.5 were measured at 20 sites spread in the Barcelona metropolitan area (1 rural background, 6 urban background, 13 road traffic sites) and at 1 reference site. Three 2-week samples per site and size fraction were collected during 2009 using low volume samplers, adding a total of 120 samples. Collected samples were analysed for elemental composition using Energy Dispersive X-ray fluorescence (XRF). EC, OC, and hopanes and steranes concentrations in PM2.5 were determined. Positive Matrix Factorisation (PMF) model was used for a source apportionment analysis. The work was performed as part of the ESCAPE project.Elements were found in concentrations within the usual range in Spanish urban areas. Mineral elements were measured in higher concentrations during the warm season, due to enhanced resuspension; concentrations of fueloil combustion elements were also higher in summer. Elements in higher concentration at the traffic sites were: Ba, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Pb, Sn, Zn and Zr. Spatial variations related to non-traffic sources were observed for concentrations of Br, Cl, K, and Na (sea salt origin) and Ni, V and S (shipping emissions), which were higher at the coastal sites, as well as for Zn and Pb, higher at sites closer to industrial facilities.Five common sources for PM10 and PM2.5 were identified by PMF: road traffic (with tracers Ba, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mo and Zn); fueloil combustion (Ni and V); secondary sulphate; industry (Pb and Zn); and mineral source (Al, Ca, Mg, Si, Sr and Ti). A marine aerosol source, a mixture of sea salt with aged anthropogenic aerosols, was found only in PM10. EC, hopanes and steranes concentrations correlate strongly with the PM10 road traffic source contributions, being hence all attributed to the same source. OC may arise from other sources in addition to road traffic and have a high contribution of secondary OC.Significant spatial and temporal variation in the PM2.5 and PM10 elemental composition was found. Spatial patterns differed per element, related to the main source. The identified source contributions can be used in health studies of source-specific particles. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

An Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM, Aerodyne Research Inc.) was deployed at the Montseny (MSY; 41° 46'46" N, 02° 21'29" E, 720 m a.s.l.) regional background site in the western Mediterranean, Spain, from June 2012 to July 2013 to measure real-time inorganic (nitrate, sulfate, ammonium and chloride) and organic submicron aerosol concentrations. Co-located measurements, including real-time submicron particulate matter (PM1) and black carbon (BC) concentrations, and off-line PM1 chemical analysis were also carried out. This is one of the few studies that compare ACSM data with off-line PM1 measurements, avoiding the tail of the coarse mode included in the PM2.5 fraction. The ACSM + BC concentrations agreed with the PM1 measurements, and a strong correlation was found between the concentrations of ACSM species and the off-line measurements, although some discrepancies remain unexplained. Results point to a current underestimation of the relative ionization efficiency (RIE) established for organic aerosol (OA), which should be revised in the future. The OA was the major component of submicron aerosol (53\% of PM1), with a higher contribution in summer (58\% of PM1) than in winter (45\% of PM1). Source apportionment of OA was carried out by applying positive matrix factorization (PMF), using the multilinear engine (ME-2) to the organic mass spectral data matrix. Three sources were identified in summer: hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), low-volatile oxygenated OA (LV-OOA), and semi-volatile oxygenated OA (SV-OOA). The secondary OA (SOA; 4.8 μg m−3, sum of LV-OOA and SV-OOA) accounted for 85\% of the total OA, and its formation during daytime (mainly SV-OOA) was estimated to be 1.1 μg m−3. In winter, HOA was also identified (12\% of OA), a contribution from biomass burning OA (BBOA) was included and it was not possible to differentiate between two different SOA factors, but a single oxygenated OA (OOA) factor was resolved. The OOA contribution represented 60\% of the total OA, with a degree of oxidation higher than both OOA summer factors. An intense wildfire episode was studied, obtaining a region-specific BBOA profile.},

  abstract = {Missing data is a frequent problem in economics, either because some variables are missing from a data set or values are missing for some observations. Researchers usually either omit the affected variables and observations or impute them. While the consequences of the former are well understood, the imputation and missing data literature has focused on the conditions under which they lead to unbiased estimates. These conditions often do not hold, but there is little evidence on the circumstances under which missing data methods improve estimates if the conditions for unbiased estimates are violated. I first examine these conditions by discussing the circumstances under which missing data methods can be beneficial and frequent sources of bias. I then discuss advantages and problems of common missing data methods. Two important problems are that most methods work well for some models, but poorly for others and that researchers often do not have enough information to use imputed observations in common data sets appropriately. To address these problems, I develop a method based on the conditional density that works well for a wide range of models and allows producers of the data to incorporate private information and expertise, but still allows users of the data to adjust the imputations to their application and use them appropriately. Applications to common problems show that the conditional density method works well in practice.},

Studies in animal models indicate that particles from combustion processes (generated by combustion of wood or diesel oil), silicate, titanium dioxide and nanoparticles (C60 fullerenes and carbon nanotubes) produce elevated levels of lipid peroxidation products and oxidatively damaged DNA. Biomonitoring studies in humans have shown associations between exposure to air pollution and wood smoke particulates and oxidative damage to DNA, deoxynucleotides and lipids measured in leukocytes, plasma, urine and/or exhaled breath. The results indicate that oxidative stress and elevated levels of oxidatively altered biomolecules are important intermediate endpoints that may be useful markers in hazard characterization of particulates.},

To improve our understanding of the composition, distribution and origin of PM2.5 in the ambient air an intensive one-year measurement campaign (from August 2007 to September 2008) was performed at five locations in the Netherlands. The five sites consist of three rural background sites, one urban background site and one curbside site. We have applied source apportionment using Positive Matrix Factorization (EPA-PMF) on the pooled data from the five sites to identify and quantify the most relevant source contributions and their spatial variability to PM2.5 in the Netherlands. The results of this study are compared to a full mass closure analysis of the data. Using EPA-PMF we could identify seven unique sources for the PM2.5 fraction: nitrate-rich secondary aerosol, sulphate-rich secondary aerosol, traffic and resuspended road dust, industrial (metal) activities/incineration, sea spray, crustal material and residual oil combustion. Wind directional analysis was used to determine the possible locations of the identified sources. On the five locations secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) is responsible for the largest contribution. The contribution of SIA to the total PM2.5 mass is largely constant at all used sites. This indicates these sources are common sources which behave like area sources and affects each site. The largest contribution of the traffic and resuspended road dust profile was found at the curbside site. Using combined data from five measurement sites provides focus on the common sources (e.g. SIA) affecting all locations.},

Our objective was to quantify the risk associated with fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure in 2 urban areas using finescale air pollution modeling and to characterize how this risk varied according to social deprivation. In Grenoble and Lyon areas (0.4 and 1.2 million inhabitants, respectively) in 2012, PM2.5 exposure was estimated on a 10  10 m grid by coupling a dispersion model to population density. Outcomes were mortality, lung cancer and term low birth weight incidences. Cases attributable to air pollution were estimated overall and stratifying areas according to the European Deprivation Index (EDI), taking 10 mg/m3 yearly average as reference (counterfactual) level. Estimations were repeated assuming spatial homogeneity of air pollutants within urban area. Median PM2.5 levels were 18.1 and 19.6 μg/m3 in Grenoble and Lyon urban areas, respectively, corresponding to 114 (5.1\% of total, 95\% confidence interval, CI, 3.2–7.0\%) and 491 non-accidental deaths (6.0\% of total, 95\% CI 3.7–8.3\%) attributable to long-term exposure to PM2.5, respectively. Attributable term low birth weight cases represented 23.6\% of total cases (9.0–37.1\%) in Grenoble and 27.6\% of cases (10.7–42.6\%) in Lyon. In Grenoble, 6.8\% of incident lung cancer cases were attributable to air pollution (95\% CI 3.1–10.1\%). Risk was lower by 8 to 20\% when estimating exposure through background stations. Risk was highest in neighborhoods with intermediate to higher social deprivation.

  abstract = {The emission of trace metal pollutants by industry and transport takes place on a scale large enough to alter atmospheric chemistry and results in measurable differences between the urban background of inhalable particulate matter (PM) in different towns. This is particularly well demonstrated by the technogenic release into the atmosphere of V, Ni, and lanthanoid elements. We compare PM concentrations of these metals in large datasets from five industrial towns in Spain variously influenced by emissions from refinery, power station, shipping, stainless steel, ceramic tiles and brick-making. Increased La/Ce values in urban background inhalable PM, due to La-contamination from refineries and their residual products (fuel oils and petcoke), contrast with Ce-rich emissions from the ceramic related industry, and clearly demonstrate the value of this ratio as a sensitive and reliable tracer for many point source emissions. Similarly, anomalously high V/Ni values ({$>$}4) can detect the influence of nearby high-V petcoke and fuel oil combustion, although the use of this ratio in urban background PM is limited by overlapping values in natural and anthropogenic materials. Geochemical characterisation of urban background PM is a valuable compliment to the physical monitoring of aerosols widely employed in urban areas, especially given the relevance of trace metal inhalation to urban health issues. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

We report on the oxidative potential (OP) of PM2.5 samples collected in the Barcelona subway system in different types of stations. The PM chemical composition of these samples showed typically high concentrations of Fe, Total Carbon, Ba, Cu, Mn, Zn and Cr sourced from rail tracks, wheels, catenaries, brake pads and pantographs. Two toxicological indicators of oxidative activity, ascorbic acid (AA) oxidation (expressed as OPAA mg1 or OPAA m3) and glutathione (GSH) oxidation (expressed as OPGSH mg1 or OPGSH m3), showed low OP for all samples (compared with outdoor air) but considerable variation between stations (0.9e2.4 OPAA mg1; 0.4e1.9 OPGSH mg1). Results indicate that subway PM toxicity is not related to variations in PM2.5 concentrations produced by ventilation changes, tunnel works, or station design, but may be affected more by the presence of metallic trace elements such as Cu and Sb sourced from brakes and pantographs. The OP assays employed do not reveal toxic effects from the highly ferruginous component present in subway dust.},

Organic aerosol is one of the most abundant, yet least understood, fractions of the Arctic aerosol mass. Here we use data from eight observatories that represent the entire Arctic to reveal the annual cycles in anthropogenic and biogenic sources of organic aerosol. We show that during winter, the organic aerosol in the Arctic is dominated by anthropogenic emissions, mainly from Eurasia, which consist of both direct combustion emissions and long-range transported, aged pollution. In summer, the decreasing anthropogenic pollution is replaced by natural emissions. These include marine secondary, biogenic secondary and primary biological emissions, which have the potential to be important to Arctic climate by modifying the cloud condensation nuclei properties and acting as ice-nucleating particles. Their source strength or atmospheric processing is sensitive to nutrient availability, solar radiation, temperature and snow cover. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the current pan-Arctic organic aerosol, which can be used to support modelling efforts that aim to quantify the climate impacts of emissions in this sensitive region.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The Arctic is warming two to three times faster than the global average, and the role of aerosols is not well constrained. Aerosol number concentrations can be very low in remote environments, rendering local cloud radiative properties highly sensitive to available aerosol. The composition and sources of the climate-relevant aerosols, affecting Arctic cloud formation and altering their microphysics, remain largely elusive due to a lack of harmonized concurrent multi-component, multi-site, and multi-season observations. Here, we present a dataset on the overall chemical composition and seasonal variability of the Arctic total particulate matter (with a size cut at 10               μ               m, PM               10               , or without any size cut) at eight observatories representing all Arctic sectors. Our holistic observational approach includes the Russian Arctic, a significant emission source area with less dedicated aerosol monitoring, and extends beyond the more traditionally studied summer period and black carbon/sulfate or fine-mode pollutants. The major airborne Arctic PM components in terms of dry mass are sea salt, secondary (non-sea-salt, nss) sulfate, and organic aerosol (OA), with minor contributions from elemental carbon (EC) and ammonium. We observe substantial spatiotemporal variability in component ratios, such as EC/OA, ammonium/nss-sulfate and OA/nss-sulfate, and fractional contributions to PM. When combined with component-specific back-trajectory analysis to identify marine or terrestrial origins, as well as the companion study by Moschos               et al               2022               Nat. Geosci.               focusing on OA, the composition analysis provides policy-guiding observational insights into sector-based differences in natural and anthropogenic Arctic aerosol sources. In this regard, we first reveal major source regions of inner-Arctic sea salt, biogenic sulfate, and natural organics, and highlight an underappreciated wintertime source of primary carbonaceous aerosols (EC and OA) in West Siberia, potentially associated with the oil and gas sector. The presented dataset can assist in reducing uncertainties in modelling pan-Arctic aerosol-climate interactions, as the major contributors to yearly aerosol mass can be constrained. These models can then be used to predict the future evolution of individual inner-Arctic atmospheric PM components in light of current and emerging pollution mitigation measures and improved region-specific emission inventories.},

In this paper, the authors perform a fair comparative study of some practical imputation methods used for handling missing values against two proposed imputation algorithms. The proposed algorithms depend on the Bayesian Ridge technique under two different feature selection conditions. The proposed algorithms differ from the existing approaches in that they cumulate the imputed features; those imputed features will be incorporated within the Bayesian Ridge equation for predicting the missing values in the next incomplete selected feature. The authors applied the proposed algorithms on eight datasets with different amount of missing values created from different missingness mechanisms. The performance was measured in terms of imputation time, root-mean-square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), and mean absolute error (MAE). The results showed that the performance varies depending on missing values percentage, size of the dataset, and the missingness mechanism. In addition, the performance of the proposed methods is slightly better.},

  abstract = {Elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC) and PM2.5 mass concentrations were measured from September 2001 through January 2002 in Mira Loma, CA. EC and OC were analyzed using the NIOSH (National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health) 5040 thermal/optical transmittance method. OC concentrations in Mira Loma were found to be higher than those of other urban sites in the South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB), while EC concentrations were comparable to or lower than those of other SoCAB sites. Overall, OC and EC concentrations accounted for 26\% and 5\% of the total PM2.5, respectively. OC/EC ratios ranged from 1.6 to 12.8 with an average of 5.2. These values were higher than those observed at other urban sites in the United States by a factor of 2. A stronger correlation between suspended OC and EC concentrations was noted in months with lower photochemical activity (December and January, r ¼ 0:82) than in months with greater photochemical activity (September and October, r ¼ 0:64). The elevated levels of OC, OC/EC ratios, and the seasonal difference in correlation between OC and EC concentrations were attributed in part to significant secondary organic aerosol formation. The fraction of total organic carbon that was secondary organic carbon (SOC) was estimated using the OC/EC minimum ratio method and Chemical Mass Balance (CMB) modeling. Based on the OC/EC minimum ratio method, the contribution of SOC to the total organic carbon tended to be higher during the months with greater photochemical activity (63\%) than those with lower photochemical activity (44\%). Based on CMB modeling, SOC contributed to 14\% of the total PM2.5 mass and 57\% of the total organic carbon during the study period. Overall, these findings suggest that photochemical activity can appreciably affect total PM2.5 mass concentrations in Mira Loma, and that measures to control emissions of SOC precursors incorporated as part of a region-wide air quality management plan could lead to a perceptible drop in total PM2.5 mass concentrations in this area. r 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Indirect effects of PM on the cardiovascular system are mediated through the autonomic nervous system, which controls heart rate variability, and inflammatory responses, which augment acute cardiovascular events and atherosclerosis. Recent research demonstrates that PM also affects the cardiovascular system directly by entry into the systemic circulation. This process causes myocardial dysfunction through mechanisms of reactive oxygen species production, calcium ion interference, and vascular dysfunction. In this review, we will present key evidence in both the direct and indirect pathways, suggest clinical applications of the current literature, and recommend directions for future research. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

Under ambient conditions, mass concentrations of particulate organics, sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and chloride are obtained with a detection limit 0.2 μg/m3 for 30min of signal averaging. The ACSM is built upon the same technology as the widely used Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS), in which an aerodynamic particle focusing lens is combined with high vacuum thermal particle vaporization, electron impact ionization, and mass spectrometry. Modifications in the ACSM design, however, allow it to be smaller, lower cost, and simpler to operate than the AMS. The ACSM is also capable of routine stable operation for long periods of time (months). Results from a field measurement campaign in Queens, NY where the ACSM operated unattended and continuously for 8 weeks, are presented. ACSM data is analyzed with the same well-developed techniques that are used for the AMS. Trends in the ACSM mass concentrations observed during the Queens, NY study compare well with those from co-located instruments. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) of the ACSM organic aerosol spectra extracts two components: hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol (HOA) and oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA). The mass spectra and time trends of both components correlate well with PMF results obtained from a co-located high resolution time-of-flight AMS instrument.

  abstract = {Abstract. In order to develop strategies for controlling and reducing Arctic air pollution, there is a need to understand the basic mechanisms for determining the fate of air pollution in the Arctic. Sources of atmospheric particles at Station Nord (81° 36' N, 16° 40' W) in North East Greenland were evaluated for a two-year period from March 2008 to February 2010. Source apportionment using Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) and COnstrained Physical REceptor Model (COPREM) was based on measurements of black carbon, elements (Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, As, Se, Br, Rb, Sr, Zr, Pb) and inorganic ions (SO2, SO42−, Na+, NH4+, NO3−, Cl2−. In general, source apportionment results by PMF and COPREM showed good agreement. Five sources adequately explained the measurements, which included a Marine and a Soil source of natural origin and three additional anthropogenic sources, which were all influenced by metal industries. One anthropogenic source was dominated by Zn of which air mass back trajectories using the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model suggested a Canadian Arctic origin, despite certain influences from Southern and Eastern origins. Another anthropogenic source was characterised by high concentrations of Pb and As, which has been historically referred to as a Combustion source at Station Nord. The impacts of large-scale industry in Siberia, Russia were evident through high Cu concentrations in both the Combustion source and an additional Cu/Ni source.  Br correlated well with the anthropogenic species S and Pb though the elements are unlikely to have a common origin. More likely, sulphuric acid aerosols serve as transport containers for Br species of marine origin. Of particular relevance to climate, sources of black carbon were identified to be mainly anthropogenic and most probably of Siberian origin (80–98\%).},

  abstract = {Particle composition data for PM10 samples collected at an urban background location in Elche in southeastern Spain from December 2004 to November 2005 were analysed to provide source identification and apportionment. A total of 120 samples were collected and analysed by Particle Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) and ion chromatography. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) was used to estimate sources profiles and their mass contributions. The PMF modelling identified six sources: PM10 mass was apportioned to secondary nitrate (26\%), secondary sulphate (22\%), local soil dust (21\%), traffic (13\%), seasalt (11\%) and African dust (7\%). It is worth noting that PMF was able to identify a Saharan dust source even in the presence of a weighty local dust source, and to quantitatively estimate the contributions of these two sources. The African dust contribution varies, depending on the intrusion days, within a range of 5–40\% of the total PM10 concentration. Without the contribution of Saharan dust, 50\% of the total exceedances of the PM10 50 mg m 3 EC limit during the studied period would not have taken place.},

  abstract = {Oxidative potential is an important property of particulate matter (PM) that has been regarded as a more health‐relevant metric than PM mass. We investigated the oxidative potential of size‐segregated PM and effects of Asian dust events in Fukuoka, western Japan. Aerosol particles with diameters smaller and larger than 2.5 μm (fine and coarse particles, respectively) were collected continually from 16 March through 26 May 2016. The oxidative potential was analyzed using dithiothreitol (DTT) assay; chemical components of PM were also found. Air‐volume normalized oxidative potential quantified by DTT assay (DTTv) was significantly higher during Asian dust events than during nondust‐event days. The mean DTTv of fine and coarse particles during Asian dust events were, respectively, 1.5 and 2.7 times higher than that during nonevent days. DTTv of fine particles was highly correlated with elements dominated by anthropogenic combustion sources and with the elements emitted from multiple sources including mineral dust and combustion sources. DTTv of coarse particles strongly correlated with the mineral dust derived elements, suggesting concentration of mineral dust particles as an important controlling factor especially for the oxidative potential of the coarse particles. We estimated the contributions of water‐soluble transition metals to the oxidative potential of PM. Water‐soluble transition metals (mainly Cu and Mn) can explain only approximately 37\% and 60\% of the measured oxidative potential of fine and coarse particles, respectively, suggesting substantial contributions of aerosol components other than water‐soluble transition metals such as quinones and insoluble minerals.},

  abstract = {Recently, several methods have been introduced and applied to estimate daily air surface temperature (Ta) using MODIS land surface temperature data (MODIS LST). Among these methods, the most common used method is statistical modeling, and the most applied algorithms are linear/multiple linear regression models (LM). There are only a handful of studies using machine learning algorithm models such as random forest (RF) or cubist regression (CB). In particular, there is no study comparing different combinations of four MODIS LST datasets with or without auxiliary data using different algorithms such as multiple linear regression, random forest, and cubist regression for daily Ta-max, Ta-min, and Ta-mean estimation. Our study examines the mentioned combinations of four MODIS-LST datasets and shows that different combinations and differently applied algorithms produce various Ta estimation accuracies. Additional analysis of daily data from three climate stations in the mountain area of North West of Vietnam for the period of five years (2009 to 2013) with four MODIS LST datasets (AQUA daytime, AQUA nighttime, TERRA daytime, and TERRA nighttime) and two additional auxiliary datasets (elevation and Julian day) shows that CB and LM should be applied if MODIS LST data is used solely. If MODIS LST is used together with auxiliary data, especially in mountainous areas, CB or RF is highly recommended. This study proved that the very high accuracy of Ta estimation (R2 {$>$} 0.93/0.80/0.89 and RMSE 1.5/2.0/1.6 °C of Ta-max, Ta-min, and Ta-mean, respectively) could be achieved with a simple combination of four LST data, elevation, and Julian day data using a suitable algorithm.},

  abstract = {Background: Although the mechanisms of airborne particulate matter (PM) related health effects remain incompletely understood, one emerging hypothesis is that these adverse effects derive from oxidative stress, initiated by the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within affected cells. Typically, ROS are formed in cells through the reduction of oxygen by biological reducing agents, with the catalytic assistance of electron transfer enzymes and redox active chemical species such as redox active organic chemicals and metals. The purpose of this study was to relate the electron transfer ability, or redox activity, of the PM samples to their content in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and various inorganic species. The redox activity of the samples has been shown to correlate with the induction of the stress protein, hemeoxygenase-1. Results: Size-fractionated (i.e. {$<$} 0.15; {$<$} 2.5 and 2.5 – 10 µm in diameter) ambient PM samples were collected from four different locations in the period from June 2003 to July 2005, and were chemically analyzed for elemental and organic carbon, ions, elements and trace metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The redox activity of the samples was evaluated by means of the dithiothreitol activity assay and was related to their chemical speciation by means of correlation analysis. Our analysis indicated a higher redox activity on a per PM mass basis for ultrafine ({$<$} 0.15 µm) particles compared to those of larger sizes. The PM redox activity was highly correlated with the organic carbon (OC) content of PM as well as the mass fractions of species such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), and selected metals. Conclusion: The results of this work demonstrate the utility of the dithiothreitol assay for quantitatively assessing the redox potential of airborne particulate matter from a wide range of sources. Studies to characterize the redox activity of PM from various sources throughout the Los Angeles basin are currently underway.},

  abstract = {The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) and tolerance are both widely used measures of the degree of multi-collinearity of the ith independent variable with the other independent variables in a regression model. Unfortunately, several rules of thumb - most commonly the rule of 10 - associated with VIF are regarded by many practitioners as a sign of severe or serious multi-collinearity (this rule appears in both scholarly articles and advanced statistical textbooks). When VIF reaches these threshold values researchers often attempt to reduce the collinearity by eliminating one or more variables from their analysis; using Ridge Regression to analyze their data; or combining two or more independent variables into a single index. These techniques for curing problems associated with multi-collinearity can create problems more serious than those they solve. Because of this, we examine these rules of thumb and find that threshold values of the VIF (and tolerance) need to be evaluated in the context of several other factors that influence the variance of regression coefficients. Values of the VIF of 10, 20, 40, or even higher do not, by themselves, discount the results of regression analyses, call for the elimination of one or more independent variables from the analysis, suggest the use of ridge regression, or require combining of independent variable into a single index. © 2007 Springer.},

Our approach combines local learning, attribute selection, and value aggregation into a single approach; it was evaluated on three datasets and using four matrix factorization algorithms. The results showed that the imputation of missing values significantly reduces the recommendation error. Two tested methods, denoted with 25-FR-ME-\textsuperscript{∗} and 10-FR-ME-\textsuperscript{∗}, significantly improved performance of all tested matrix factorization algorithms, without the requirement to use a different recommendation algorithm for the users in the cold start state.},

  abstract = {A number of advances have been made toward solving receptor modeling problems using advanced factor analysis methods. Most recently, a factor analysis method has been developed for source apportionment utilizing aerosol compositional data with varying temporal resolution. The data used in that study had time resolutions ranged from 10 min to 1 h. In this work, this expanded model is tested using a data set from the Ponca Street site of the Baltimore supersite with time resolutions ranging from 30 min to 24 h. The nature of this data set implies that traditional eigenvalue-based methods cannot adequately resolve source factors for the atmospheric situation under consideration. Also, valuable temporal information is lost if one averaged or interpolated data in an attempt to produce a data set of the identical time resolution. Each data point has been used in its original time schedule and the source contributions were averaged to correspond to the specific sampling time interval. A weighting coefficient, w24, was incorporated in the modeling equations in order to improve data fitting for the 24-h data in the model. A total of nine sources were resolved:oil-fired power plant (2\%), diesel emissions (1\%), secondary sulfate (23\%), coal-fired power plant (3\%), incinerator (9\%), steel plant (12\%), aged sea salt (1\%), secondary nitrate (23\%), and spark-ignition emissions (26\%). The results showed the very strong influence of the adjacent interstate highways I-95 and I-895 as well as the tunnel toll booths located to the south of the sampling site. Most of the sulfate observed was found to be associated with distant coal-fired power plants situated in the heavily industrialized midwestern parts of the United States. The contribution of the steel plant (o10 miles, 1411SE) to the observed PM concentrations (12\%) was also significant.},

The algorithm is of the lasso type, introduced by Tibshirani in 1996 as a linear regression method with bound on the absolute length of the parameters, but a modification is suggested to cope with the singular design matrix most often seen in chemometric calibration. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm may be generalized to all convex norms like ∑|βj|γ where γ ≥ 1, i.e. a method that continuously varies from ridge regression to the lasso. The lasso is applied both directly as a calibration method and as a method to select important variables/wavelengths. It is demonstrated that the lasso algorithm, in general, leads to parameter estimates of which some are zero while others are quite large (compared to e.g. the traditional PLS or RR estimates). By using several benchmark data sets, it is shown that both the direct lasso method and the regression where the lasso acts as a wavelength selection method most often outperform the PLS and RR methods.

The filtered particles were extracted with dichloromethane/methanol and the crude extracts were methylated for separation by thin layer chromatography into hydrocarbon, carbonyl, carboxylic acid ester and polar fractions. Then, the total extract and individual fractions were analyzed by GC–MS. The major organic components directly emitted in grass smoke particles were the homologous series of n-alkanoic acids from plant lipids, n-alkanes from epicuticular wax, and sterols and triterpenols. The major natural products altered by combustion included pyrolysis products from cellulose and lignin biopolymers, and oxidation products from triterpenoids and sterols. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were also present; however, only as minor components. Although the concentrations of organic compounds in smoke aerosols are highly variable and dependent on combustion temperature, the biomarkers and their combustion alteration products are in these cases source specific. The major components are adsorbed on or trapped in smoke particulate matter and thus may be utilized as molecular tracers in the atmosphere for determining fuel type and source contributions from grass burning.},

The NMR data revealed the presence of unaltered biomolecules (cellulose, proteins) and low contents of aromatic C (15\%) in the charred pine wood and cones while the charred soil samples exhibited higher contents of aromatic C (39–56\%). The solvent extraction of charred and uncharred plant and soil samples yielded diterpenoids, triterpenoids, steroids, a series of aliphatic lipids, phenols and carbohydrates indicating the predominant input of higher plant OM and minor contributions from microorganisms and/or fauna. The lower yield of solvent extractable aliphatic lipids in the charred samples versus the uncharred samples suggests that these compounds are thermally degraded during a wildfire. Molecular markers for the burning of cellulose (levoglucosan, mannosan, galactosan) were detected in all charred samples. The comparison of charred and uncharred samples allowed the identification of unaltered pine derived biomolecules and their thermal alteration products in the charred samples. Terpenoid and steroid biomolecules were in part altered during incomplete combustion to aromatic, unsaturated and polar derivatives (‘‘pyromolecules’’) that still retained the characteristic skeleton of their precursors. Since some of the polar degradation products found in the charred soils can be generated either from thermal or microbial degradation, the aromatic and unsaturated hydrocarbon products are preferred as molecular markers for SOM burning. Ratios of biological precursors to aromatic (diterpenoids) or unsaturated products (steroids) indicate that the cyclic lipids in the pine wood and the soil surface horizon were highly altered. In conclusion, the solvent extractable lipids and carbohydrates in charred SOM are valuable, source-specific molecular markers for the burning of plant biomass and for tracing the biogeochemistry of charred residues in soils.},

  abstract = {Background: Studies have reported associations between maternal exposure to atmospheric pollution and lower birth weight. However, the evidence is not consistent and uncertainties remain. We used advanced statistical approaches to robustly estimate the association of atmospheric pollutant exposure during specific pregnancy time windows with term birth weight (TBW) in a nationwide study. Methods: Among 13,334 women from the French Longitudinal Study of Children (ELFE) cohort, exposures to PM2.5, PM10 (particles {$<$} 2.5 µm and {$<$}10 µm) and NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) were estimated using a fine spatio-temporal exposure model. We used inverse probability scores and doubly robust methods in generalized additive models accounting for spatial autocorrelation to study the association of such exposures with TBW. Results: First trimester exposures were associated with an increased TBW. Second trimester exposures were associated with a decreased TBW by 17.1 g (95\% CI, −26.8, −7.3) and by 18.0 g (−26.6, −9.4) for each 5 µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 and PM10, respectively, and by 15.9 g (−27.6, −4.2) for each 10 µg/m3 increase in NO2. Third trimester exposures (truncated at 37 gestational weeks) were associated with a decreased TBW by 48.1 g (−58.1, −38.0) for PM2.5, 38.1 g (−46.7, −29.6) for PM10 and 14.7 g (−25.3, −4.0) for NO2. Effects of pollutants on TBW were larger in rural areas. Conclusions: Our results support an adverse effect of air pollutant exposure on TBW. We highlighted a larger effect of air pollutants on TBW among women living in rural areas compared to women living in urban areas.},

  abstract = {We review oxidative stress‐related newborn disease and the mechanism of oxidative damage. In addition, we outline diagnostic and therapeutic strategies and future directions. Many reports have defined oxidative stress as an imbalance between an enhanced reactive oxygen/nitrogen species and the lack of protective ability of antioxidants. From that point of view, free radical‐induced damage caused by oxidative stress seems to be a probable contributing factor to the pathogenesis of many newborn diseases, such as respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, periventricular leukomalacia, necrotizing enterocolitis, patent ductus arteriosus, and retinopathy of prematurity. We share the hope that the new understanding of the concept of oxidative stress and its relation to newborn diseases that has been made possible by new diagnostic techniques will throw light on the treatment of those diseases.},

Temporal variations (daily, seasonal and long term), sources and source regions of EM aerosols were delineated. Concentrations of elements with marine and crustal origin were more episodic as compared to anthropogenic ones. Most of the variables showed well defined seasonal cycles. Concentrations of crustal elements increased in summer while winter concentrations of marine elements were considerably higher than in summer. Trends in concentrations were analyzed using the Kendall test. Essentially, all elements showed decreasing trends. Sen's slope was applied to find the magnitude of the trends. The annual rate of decrease was found to change from 0.001 to 209 ng m -3. A receptor-based model, Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF), resolved five factors influencing the chemical composition of EM aerosols as airborne dust, oil combustion, coal combustion, motor vehicle emissions and sea salt. Potential Source Contribution Function (PSCF) analysis was performed to identify the likely areas influencing the chemical composition of aerosol samples. Local and remote sources were detected for the factors resolved by PMF. PSCF maps including backward trajectories at starting height of 900 hPa have indicated that North Africa is the major source contributing to the concentrations of variables associated with dust factor. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

It is shown that each mode of principal component analysis or 'factor analysis' is equivalent to solving a certain least squares problem where certain error estimators aij are assumed for the measured data matrix Xii. Selecting the mode (e.g. Q-mode) implicitly selects a scaling transformation as a preparatory step. Each scaling corresponds optimally to a certain Q. It is shown that the customary modes (Q-mode and R-mode) correspond to such error estimates which do not normally occur in chemistry or physics. The best possible scaling ('optimal scaling') and a near-optimal scaling are introduced. The Quail Roost II air pollution simulation data sets are studied as examples: it is shown that the x2 values produced by the new alternatives are smaller by a factor of 10. Thus one would also expect that the factors are more precise. However, the values of the factors are not monitored in the present work.},

  abstract = {A new variant ‘ P M F of factor analysis is described. It is assumed that X is a matrix of observed data and u is the known matrix of standard deviations of elements of X. Both X and u are of dimensions n x m. The method solves the bilinear matrix problem X = GF + E where G is the unknown left hand factor matrix (scores) of dimensions n x p , F is the unknown right hand factor matrix (loadings) of dimensions p x m, and E is the matrix of residuals. The problem is solved in the weighted least squares sense: G and F are determined so that the Frobenius norm of E divided (element-by-element) by u is minimized. Furthermore, the solution is constrained so that all the elements of G and F are required to be non-negative. It is shown that the solutions by PMF are usually different from any solutions produced by the customary factor analysis (FA, i.e. principal component analysis (PCA) followed by rotations). Usually PMF produces a better fit to the data than FA. Also, the result of P F is guaranteed to be non-negative, while the result of FA often cannot be rotated so that all negative entries would be eliminated. Different possible application areas of the new method are briefly discussed. In environmental data, the error estimates of data can be widely varying and non-negativity is often an essential feature of the underlying models. Thus it is concluded that PMF is better suited than FA or PCA in many environmental applications. Examples of successful applications of PMF are shown in companion papers.},

  abstract = {Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) is a least-squares approach for solving the factor analysis problem. It has been implemented in several forms. Initially, a program called PMF2 was used. Subsequently, a new, more flexible modeling tool, the Multilinear Engine, was developed. These programs can utilize different approaches to handle the problem of rotational indeterminacy. Although both utilize non-negativity constraints to reduce rotational freedom, such constraints are generally insufficient to wholly eliminate the rotational problem. Additional approaches to control rotations are discussed in this paper: (1) global imposition of additions among ‘‘scores’’ and subtractions among the corresponding ‘‘loadings’’ (or vice versa), (2) constraining individual factor elements, either scores and/or loadings, toward zero values, (3) prescribing values for ratios of certain key factor elements, or (4) specifying certain columns of the loadings matrix as known fixed values. It is emphasized that application of these techniques must be based on some external information about acceptable or desirable shapes of factors. If no such a priori information exists, then the full range of possible rotations can be explored, but there is no basis for choosing one of these rotations as the ‘‘best’’ result. Methods for estimating the rotational ambiguity in any specific result are discussed. D 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Eleven years of chemical data (2004-2014) were used for this study. Trends of both species concentrations and source contributions were studied using the Mann-Kendall test for linear trends and a new approach based on multi-exponential fit of the data. Despite the fact that different PM fractions (PM2.5, PM10) showed linear decreasing trends at both stations, the contributions of specific sources of pollutants and of their chemical tracers showed exponential decreasing trends. The different types of trends observed reflected the different effectiveness and/or time of implementation of the measures taken to reduce the concentrations of atmospheric pollutants. Moreover, the trends of the contributions of specific sources such as those related with industrial activities and with primary energy consumption mirrored the effect of the financial crisis in Spain from 2008. The sources that showed statistically significant downward trends at both Barcelona (BCN) and Montseny (MSY) during 2004-2014 were secondary sulfate, secondary nitrate, and V-Ni-bearing source. The contributions from these sources decreased exponentially during the considered period, indicating that the observed reductions were not gradual and consistent over time. Conversely, the trends were less steep at the end of the period compared to the beginning, thus likely indicating the attainment of a lower limit. Moreover, statistically significant decreasing trends were observed for the contributions to PM from the industrial/traffic source at MSY (mixed metallurgy and road traffic) and from the industrial (metallurgy mainly) source at BCN. These sources were clearly linked with anthropogenic activities, and the observed decreasing trends confirmed the effectiveness of pollution control measures implemented at European or regional/local levels. Conversely, at regional level, the contributions from sources mostly linked with natural processes, such as aged marine and aged organics, did not show statistically significant trends. The trends observed for the PM10 source contributions reflected the trends observed for the chemical tracers of these pollutant sources well.},

  abstract = {Here we report results of a detailed analysis of the urban and non-urban contributions to particulate matter (PM) concentrations and source contributions in five European cities, namely Schiedam (the Netherlands, NL), Lens (France, FR), Leipzig (Germany, DE), Zurich (Switzerland, CH) and Barcelona (Spain, ES). PM chemically speciated data from 12 European paired monitoring sites (one traffic, five urban, five regional and one continental background) were analysed by positive matrix factorisation (PMF) and Lenschow's approach to assign measured PM and source contributions to the different spatial levels. Five common sources were obtained at the 12 sites: sulfate-rich (SSA) and nitrate-rich (NSA) aerosols, road traffic (RT), mineral matter (MM), and aged sea salt (SS). These sources explained from 55 \% to 88 \% of PM mass at urban low-traffic-impact sites (UB) depending on the country. Three additional common sources were identified at a subset of sites/countries, namely biomass burning (BB) (FR, CH and DE), explaining an additional 9 \%-13 \% of PM mass, and residual oil combustion (V-Ni) and primary industrial (IND) (NL and ES), together explaining an additional 11 \%-15 \% of PM mass. In all countries, the majority of PM measured at UB sites was of a regional+continental (R+C) nature (64 \%-74 \%). The R+C PM increments due to anthropogenic emissions in DE, NL, CH, ES and FR represented around 66 \%, 62 \%, 52 \%, 32 \% and 23 \%, respectively, of UB PM mass. Overall, the R+C PM increments due to natural and anthropogenic sources showed opposite seasonal profiles with the former increasing in summer and the latter increasing in winter, even if exceptions were observed. In ES, the anthropogenic R+C PM increment was higher in summer due to high contributions from regional SSA and V-Ni sources, both being mostly related to maritime shipping emissions at the Spanish sites. Conversely, in the other countries, higher anthropogenic R+C PM increments in winter were mostly due to high contributions from NSA and BB regional sources during the cold season. On annual average, the sources showing higher R+C increments were SSA (77 \%-91 \% of SSA source contribution at the urban level), NSA (51 \%-94 \%), MM (58 \%-80 \%), BB (42 \%-78 \%) and IND (91 \% in NL). Other sources showing high R+C increments were photochemistry and coal combustion (97 \%-99 \%; identified only in DE). The highest regional SSA increment was observed in ES, especially in summer, and was related to ship emissions, enhanced photochemistry and peculiar meteorological patterns of the Western Mediterranean. The highest R+C and urban NSA increments were observed in NL and associated with high availability of precursors such as NOx and NH3. Conversely, on average, the sources showing higher local increments were RT (62 \%-90 \% at all sites) and V-Ni (65 \%-80 \% in ES and NL). The relationship between SSA and V-Ni indicated that the contribution of ship emissions to the local sulfate concentrations in NL has strongly decreased since 2007 thanks to the shift from high-sulfur-to low-sulfur-content fuel used by ships. An improvement of air quality in the five cities included here could be achieved by further reducing local (urban) emissions of PM, NOx and NH3 (from both traffic and non-traffic sources) but also SO2 and PM (from maritime ships and ports) and giving high relevance to non-urban contributions by further reducing emissions of SO2 (maritime shipping) and NH3 (agriculture) and those from industry, regional BB sources and coal combustion.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a practical method for estimating source attribution by using a three-step methodology. The main objective of this study is to explore the use of the three-step methodology for quantifying the source impacts of 24-h PM2.5 particles at an urban site in Seoul, Korea. 12-h PM2.5 samples were collected and analyzed for their elemental composition by ICP-AES/ICP-MS/AAS to generate the source composition profiles. In order to assess the daily average PM2.5 source impacts, 24-h PM2.5 and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) ambient samples were simultaneously collected at the same site. The PM2.5 particle samples were then analyzed for trace elements. Ionic and carbonaceous species concentrations were measured by ICP-AES/ICP-MS/AAS, IC, and a selective thermal MnO2 oxidation method. The 12-h PM2.5 chemical data was used to estimate possible source signatures using the principal component analysis (PCA) and the absolute principal component scores method followed by the multiple linear regression analysis. The 24-h PM2.5 source categories were extracted with a combination of PM2.5 and some PAH chemical data using the PCA, and their quantitative source contributions were estimated by chemical mass balance (CMB) receptor model using the estimated source profiles and those in the literature. The results of PM2.5 source apportionment using the 12-h derived source composition profiles show that the CMB performance indices; v2, R2, and percent of mass accounted for are 2.3\%, 0.97\%, and 100.7\%, which are within the target range specified. According to the average PM2.5 source contribution estimate results, motor vehicle exhaust was the major contributor at the sampling site, contributing 26\% on average of measured PM2.5 mass (41.8 lg m3), followed by secondary sulfate (23\%) and nitrate (16\%), refuse incineration (15\%), soil dust (13\%), field burning (4\%), oil combustion (2.7\%), and marine aerosol (1.3\%). It can be concluded that quantitative source attribution to PM2.5 in an urban area where source profiles have not been developed can be estimated using the proposed three-step methodology approach.},

However, it is unlikely that all fine particles are equally toxic in view of their different sizes and chemical components. Toxicity of fine particles produced from various combustion sources (diesel engine, gasoline engine, biomass burning (rice straw and pine stem burning), and coal combustion) and non-combustion sources (road dust including sea spray aerosols, ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, and secondary organic aerosols (SOA)), which are known major sources of PM               2.5               , was determined. Multiple biological and chemical endpoints were integrated for various source-specific aerosols to derive toxicity scores for particles originating from different sources. The highest toxicity score was obtained for diesel engine exhaust particles, followed by gasoline engine exhaust particles, biomass burning particles, coal combustion particles, and road dust, suggesting that traffic plays the most critical role in enhancing the toxic effects of fine particles. The toxicity ranking of fine particles produced from various sources can be used to better understand the adverse health effects caused by different fine particle types in the ambient atmosphere, and to provide practical management of fine particles beyond what can be achieved only using PM mass which is the current regulation standard.},

  abstract = {Toxicological data and exposure levels of fine particulate matters (PM2.5) are necessary to better understand their health effects. Simultaneous measurements of PM2.5 oxidative potential (OP) and cell toxicity in urban areas (Beijing, China and Gwangju, Korea) reveal their dependence on chemical composition. Notably, acids (Polar), benzocarboxylic acids, and Pb were the chemical components that affected both OP and cell toxicity. OP varied more significantly among different locations and seasons (winter and summer) than cell toxicity. Using the measured OP, cell toxicity, and PM2.5 concentration, a health index was developed to better assess the potential health effects of PM2.5. The health index was related to the sources of PM2.5 derived from the measured chemical components. The contributions of secondary organic aerosols and dust to the proposed health index were more significant than their contributions to PM2.5 mass. The developed regression equation was used to predict the health effect of PM2.5 without further toxicity measurements. This new index could be a valuable health metric that provides information beyond just the PM2.5 concentration level.},

  abstract = {Logistic regression is being used increasingly to develop regional-scale predictive models of species distributions for use in regional conservation planning. These models are usually developed using automated stepwise procedures to select the explanatory variables to include in each model and to fit the functions relating each of these variables to the probability of species occurrence. Available procedures for fitting logistic regression models differ in terms of a number of factors, including the basic modelling technique employed (generalised linear or generalised additive modelling), the strategy used to select explanatory variables and to determine the complexity of fitted functions, and the approach used to correct for multiple testing. This study evaluates the effect that each of these factors has on the predictive accuracy of fitted models, using fauna and flora survey data from north-east New South Wales. The results suggest that predictive accuracy is maximised by employing variable selection procedures that stringently guard against the inclusion of extraneous variables in a model, such as forwards selection with a 5\% significance level and removal of insignificant variables at each stage of the selection process. Models fitted using generalised additive modelling were more accurate than those derived using generalised linear modelling. The best approach to controlling the complexity of fitted models was less clear, as it tended to vary between the biological groups examined. Small reptile species were best modelled by complex relationships (3 or 4 df), and vascular plants and diurnal birds by simple relationships (1 or 2 df). Correction for multiple testing using the Bonferroni correction factor did not improve the accuracy of models. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract = {Particulate matter (PM) is a major air pollutant linked to multiple adverse health effects, usually expressed by mass concentrations. The Oxidative Potential (OP), i.e., the ability of PM to induce oxidative stress based on its chemical composition is emerging as a potentially relevant health indicator. Source-specific, massnormalized OP values have been obtained through measurement campaigns and the use of Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF). Chemical transport models (CTMs) aim to integrate these values to simulate sourcespecific OP exposure maps, advancing the understanding of the effect of OP on air pollution-related health impact. However, validation of this approach is needed, whereby matching between CTM and PMF sources is a crucial first step. This study matches the CTM LOTOS-EUROS sources against PMF profiles from PM10 observations at 15 locations in France between 2013-2016. A source- and species-dependent OP map was constructed with LOTOS-EUROS, based on the intrinsic OP derived from the PMF profiles. Comparing PM10 showed a satisfactory fit between LOTOS-EUROS and observations [r2 = 0.35 – 0.66]. Results from the source matching varied between station and source, with Biomass Burning [r2 = 0.34 – 0.75], SIA-rich [r2: 0.30 – 0.71], and Sea salt [r2: 0.18 – 0.71] showing promising fits for non-alpine stations, while other sources such as road-traffic [r2 range = 0.01 – 0.40] showed to be more challenging. This work shows the feasibility and complexity of integrating CTM and PMF frameworks for source-specific OP modelling. By identifying knowledge gaps and improving source allocated PM components, this study contributes to the developing field of OP modelling.},

Several studies considered the relation between long-term exposure to particulate matter (PM) and total mortality, as well as mortality from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Our aim was to provide a comprehensive review of European epidemiological studies on the issue. Methods. We searched the Medline database for epidemiological studies on air pollution and health outcomes published between January 2002 and December 2007. We also examined the reference lists of individual papers and reviews. Two independent reviewers classified the studies according to type of air pollutant, duration of exposure and health outcome considered. Among European investigations that examined long-term PM exposure we found 4 cohort studies (considering total and cardiopulmonary mortality), 1 case-control study (considering mortality from myocardial infarction), and 4 ecologic studies (2 studies considering total and cardiopulmonary mortality and 2 studies focused on cardiovascular mortality). Results. Measurement indicators of PM exposure used in European studies, including PM10, PM2.5, total suspended particulate and black smoke, were heterogeneous. This notwithstanding, in all analytic studies total mortality was directly associated with long-term exposure to PM. The excesses in mortality were mainly due to cardiovascular and respiratory causes. Three out of 4 ecologic studies found significant direct associations between PM indexes and mortality. Conclusion. European studies on long-term exposure to PM indicate a direct association with mortality, particularly from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. © 2009 Pelucchi et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.}

Design, Setting, and Participants Using a database assembled for 108 US counties with daily cardiovascular and respiratory disease admission rates, temperature and dew-point temperature, and PM10-2.5 and PM2.5 concentrations were calculated with monitoring data as an exposure surrogate from January 1, 1999, through December 31, 2005. Admission rates were constructed from the Medicare National Claims History Files, for a study population of approximately 12 million Medicare enrollees living on average 9 miles (14.4 km) from collocated pairs of PM10 and PM2.5 monitors. Main Outcome Measures Daily counts of county-wide emergency hospital admissions for primary diagnoses of cardiovascular or respiratory disease. Results There were 3.7 million cardiovascular disease and 1.4 million respiratory disease admissions. A 10-µg/m3 increase in PM10-2.5 was associated with a 0.36\% (95\% posterior interval [PI], 0.05\% to 0.68\%) increase in cardiovascular disease admissions on the same day. However, when adjusted for PM2.5, the association was no longer statistically significant (0.25\%; 95\% PI, −0.11\% to 0.60\%). A 10-µg/m3 increase in PM10-2.5 was associated with a nonstatistically significant unadjusted 0.33\% (95\% PI, −0.21\% to 0.86\%) increase in respiratory disease admissions and with a 0.26\% (95\% PI, −0.32\% to 0.84\%) increase in respiratory disease admissions when adjusted for PM2.5. The unadjusted associations of PM2.5 with cardiovascular and respiratory disease admissions were 0.71\% (95\% PI, 0.45\%-0.96\%) for same-day exposure and 0.44\% (95\% PI, 0.06\% to 0.82\%) for exposure 2 days before hospital admission. Conclusion After adjustment for PM2.5, there were no statistically significant associations between coarse particulates and hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.},

  abstract = {Background: Population-based studies have estimated health risks of short-term exposure to fine particles using mass of PM2.5 (particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter) as the indicator. Evidence regarding the toxicity of the chemical components of the PM2.5 mixture is limited. Objective: In this study we investigated the association between hospital admission for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and respiratory disease and the chemical components of PM2.5 in the United States. Methods: We used a national database comprising daily data for 2000-2006 on emergency hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory outcomes, ambient levels of major PM2.5 chemical components [sulfate, nitrate, silicon, elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon matter (OCM), and sodium and ammonium ions], and weather. Using Bayesian hierarchical statistical models, we estimated the associations between daily levels of PM2.5 components and risk of hospital admissions in 119 U.S. urban communities for 12 million Medicare enrollees (≥ 65 years of age). Results: In multiple-pollutant models that adjust for the levels of other pollutants, an interquartile range (IQR) increase in EC was associated with a 0.80\% [95\% posterior interval (PI), 0.34-1.27\%] increase in risk of same-day cardiovascular admissions, and an IQR increase in OCM was associated with a 1.01\% (95\% PI, 0.04-1.98\%) increase in risk of respiratory admissions on the same day. Other components were not associated with cardiovascular or respiratory hospital admissions in multiple-pollutant models. Conclusions: Ambient levels of EC and OCM, which are generated primarily from vehicle emissions, diesel, and wood burning, were associated with the largest risks of emergency hospitalization across the major chemical constituents of PM2.5.},

  abstract = {Results on interpretation of the variability of regional background PM levels in the Western Mediterranean basin (WMB) are presented. Mean PM levels recorded at Montseny, MSY (North-Eastern Spain) in the 2002-2007 period reached 17, 13 and 11 μg/m3 of PM10, PM2.5 and PM1, respectively. The daily evolution of PM levels is regulated by the breeze circulation (mountain and sea breezes). PM levels are lower at the rural sites at night owing to the nocturnal drainage flows and to the lowering of the mixing layer height below the MSY high. These nocturnal low levels allowed us to estimate the continental background PM levels. At midday, the atmospheric pollutants accumulated in the pre-coastal depression are transported upwards by the breeze, increasing PM levels. Maximum PM10 levels were recorded in summer, and February-March and November, and minimum values in the rest of the year coinciding with the highest frequency of Atlantic advection. PM peak episodes attributed to Saharan dust outbreaks were recorded in summer and February-March. In addition, anticyclonic situations (February-March and November) may impact in elevated rural areas by increasing hourly levels of PM1 up to 75 μg/m3. This scenario induces the stagnation of pollutants in the pre-coastal depression. Solar radiation activates mountain winds, transporting polluted air masses from the valleys to elevated areas resulting in an increase of fine PM levels in areas outside the boundary layer. A significant decrease in PM annual means (40\% and 34\% for the entire monitoring period, 7 μgPM10/m3 and 5 μgPM2.5/m3) was recorded at MSY between 2002 and 2007. There appears to be no single cause behind these trends. This could partially be ascribed to the varying frequency and intensity of Saharan dust episodes, but also to large-scale meteorological processes or cycles, and/or to local or meso-scale processes such as nearby anthropogenic emission sources. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, in order to be fully representative of PM pollution, a comprehensive source apportionment analysis is needed by taking into account all major components of submicron aerosols, creating strengthened bonds between the organic components and pollution sources. We present here a novel two-step methodology to perform such an analysis, by taking advantage of high time resolution of monitoring instruments: the aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM) and the multi-wavelength absorption measurements (Aethalometer AE31) in Paris, France. As a first step, organic aerosols (OA) were deconvolved to hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), biomass burning OA (BBOA) and oxygenated OA (OOA) with positive matrix factorization (PMF), and black carbon was deconvolved into its wood burning and fossil fuel combustion fractions. A second PMF analysis was then carried out with organic factors, BC fractions and inorganic species (nitrate, sulfate, ammonium, chloride), leading to a four-factor solution allowing highly time-resolved characterization of the major sources of PM1. Outputs of this PMF2 include two dominant combustion sources (wood burning and traffic) as well as semi-volatile and low-volatile secondary aerosols. While HOA is found to be emitted by both wood burning and traffic, the latter sources occurred to significantly contribute also to OOA.},

Nine factors were clearly identified, showing mainly contributions from anthropogenic sources of primary PM (19.2\% and 16.1\% for traffic and biomass burning, respectively) as well as secondary aerosols (12.3\%, 14.5\%, 21.8\% for sulfate-, nitrate-, and oxalate-rich factors, respectively). Wood-burning aerosols exhibited strong temporal variations and contributed up to 30\% of the PM mass fraction during winter, while primary traffic concentrations remained relatively constant throughout the year. These two sources are also the main contributors during observed PM10 pollution episodes. Furthermore, the dominance of the oxalate-rich factor among other secondary aerosol factors underlines the role of atmospheric processing to secondary organic aerosol loadings which are still poorly characterized in this region. Finally, Concentration-Weighted Trajectory (CWT) analysis were performed to investigate the geographical origins of the apportioned sources, notably illustrating a significant transport of both nitrate-rich and sulfate-rich factors from Northeastern Europe but also from the Balkan region.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Since early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to lockdowns at national scales. These lockdowns resulted in large cuts of atmospheric pollutant emissions, notably related to the vehicular traffic source, especially during spring~2020. As a result, air quality changed in manners that are still currently under investigation. The robust quantitative assessment of the impact of lockdown measures on ambient concentrations is however hindered by weather variability. In order to circumvent this difficulty, an innovative methodology has been developed. The Analog Application for Air Quality (A3Q) method is based on the comparison of each day of lockdown to a group of analog days having similar meteorological conditions. The A3Q method has been successfully evaluated and applied to a comprehensive in situ dataset of primary and secondary pollutants obtained at the SIRTA observatory, a suburban background site of the megacity of Paris (France). The overall slight decrease of submicron particulate matter (PM1) concentrations (−14\,\%) compared to business-as-usual conditions conceals contrasting behaviors. Primary traffic tracers (NOx and traffic-related carbonaceous aerosols) dropped by 42\,\%–66\,\% during the lockdown period. Further, the A3Q method enabled us to characterize changes triggered by NOx decreases. Particulate nitrate and secondary organic aerosols (SOAs), two of the main springtime aerosol components in northwestern Europe, decreased by −45\,\% and −25\,\%, respectively. A NOx relationship emphasizes the interest of NOx mitigation policies at the regional (i.e., city) scale, although long-range pollution advection sporadically overcompensated for regional decreases. Variations of the oxidation state of SOA suggest discrepancies in SOA formation processes. At the same time, the expected ozone increase (+20\,\%) underlines the negative feedback of NO titration. These results provide a quasi-comprehensive observation-based insight for mitigation policies regarding air quality in future low-carbon urban areas.},

To this end 2002-2007 PM speciation data from an European Supersite for Atmospheric Aerosol Research (Montseny, MSY, located 40 km NNE of Barcelona in NE Spain) were evaluated, with these data being considered representative of regional background aerosols in the Western Mediterranean Basin. The mean PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 levels at MSY during 2002-2007 were 16, 14 and 11 μg/m3, respectively. After compiling data on regional background PM speciation from Europe to compare our data, it is evidenced that the Western Mediterranean aerosol is characterised by higher concentrations of crustal material but lower levels of OM + EC and ammonium nitrate than at central European sites. Relatively high PM2.5 concentrations due to the transport of anthropogenic aerosols (mostly carbonaceous and sulphate) from populated coastal areas were recorded, especially during winter anticyclonic episodes and summer midday PM highs (the latter associated with the transport of the breeze and the expansion of the mixing layer). Source apportionment analyses indicated that the major contributors to PM2.5 and PM10 were secondary sulphate, secondary nitrate and crustal material, whereas the higher load of the anthropogenic component in PM2.5 reflects the influence of regional (traffic and industrial) emissions. Levels of mineral, sulphate, sea spray and carbonaceous aerosols were higher in summer, whereas nitrate levels and Cl/Na were higher in winter. A considerably high OC/EC ratio (14 in summer, 10 in winter) was detected, which could be due to a combination of high biogenic emissions of secondary organic aerosol, SOA precursors, ozone levels and insolation, and intensive recirculation of aged air masses. Compared with more locally derived crustal geological dusts, African dust intrusions introduce relatively quartz-poor but clay mineral-rich silicate PM, with more kaolinitic clays from central North Africa in summer, and more smectitic clays from NW Africa in spring. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Abstract. The province of Alberta, Canada, is home to three oil sands regions which, combined, contain the third largest deposit of oil in the world. Of these, the Athabasca oil sands region is the largest. As part of Environment and Climate Change Canada's program in support of the Joint Canada-Alberta Implementation Plan for Oil Sands Monitoring program, concentrations of trace elements in PM2.\,5 (particulate matter smaller than 2.5\,µm in diameter) were measured through two campaigns that involved different methodologies: a long-term filter campaign and a short-term intensive campaign. In the long-term campaign, 24\,h filter samples were collected once every 6~days over a 2-year period (December~2010–November~2012) at three air monitoring stations in the regional municipality of Wood Buffalo. For the intensive campaign (August~2013), hourly measurements were made with an online instrument at one air monitoring station; daily filter samples were also collected. The hourly and 24\,h filter data were analyzed individually using positive matrix factorization. Seven emission sources of PM2.\,5 trace elements were thereby identified: two types of upgrader emissions, soil, haul road dust, biomass burning, and two sources of mixed origin. The upgrader emissions, soil, and haul road dust sources were identified through both the methodologies and both methodologies identified a mixed source, but these exhibited more differences than similarities. The second upgrader emissions and biomass burning sources were only resolved by the hourly and filter methodologies, respectively. The similarity of the receptor modeling results from the two methodologies provided reassurance as to the identity of the sources. Overall, much of the PM2.\,5-related trace elements were found to be anthropogenic, or at least to be aerosolized through anthropogenic activities. These emissions may in part explain the previously reported higher levels of trace elements in snow, water, and biota samples collected near the oil sands operations.},

To investigate whether such communalities can be found and are applicable at Country-scale, we propose here a novel methodological approach. A dataset comprising season-averages of PM10 mass concentration and chemical composition data was built, covering the decade 2005–2016 and referring to urban sites only (21 cities). Statistical analyses, estimation of missing data, identification of latent clusters and source apportionment modeling by Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) were performed on this unique dataset.

  abstract = {This work is an overview of the oxidative potential (OP) values up to date measured in Italy, with the aim to provide a picture of the spatial and seasonal variability of OP in the various geographical areas across Italy. The summarized works used the common acellular assays‐based dithiothreitol (OPDTT), ascorbic acid (OPAA), glutathione (OPGSH), and 2ʹ,7ʹ‐dichlorodfluorescein (OPDCFH) assays. The paper describes the association of OP responses with PM chemical composition, the sensitivity of various acellular OP assays to PM components and emission sources, and PM size distribution of the measured OP values. Our synthesis indicates that crustal and transition metals (e.g., Fe, Ni, Cu, Cr, Mn, Zn, and V), secondary ions and carbonaceous components (elemental carbon, EC, organic carbon, OC and water soluble carbon, WSOC) show significant correlations with OP across different urban and rural areas and size ranges. These chemical species are mainly associated with various PM sources, including residual/fuel oil combustion, traffic emissions, and secondary organic aerosol formation. Although the OP assays are sensitive to the same redox‐active species, they differ in the association with PM chemical components. The DDT assay is mainly sensitive to the organic compounds that are mostly accumulated in the fine PM fraction, i.e., tracers of burning sources, and redox active organics associated with other markers of photochemical aging. In contrast, OPAA and OPGSH were mostly responsive to metals, mainly those related to non‐exhaust traffic emissions (Cu, Zn, Cr, Fe, Ni, Mn, Sn, Cd, Pb), that are mainly accumulated in the coarse PM. Among the investigated sites, our synthesis shows larger OP values in Trentino region and the Po Valley, that may be explained by the high density of anthropogenic sources, and the orographic and meteorological characteristics, that favor the pollutants accumulation and aerosol photo‐oxidative aging.},

Several synergistic and antagonistic interactions were found that significantly change the redox properties of their binary mixtures, increasing or decreasing the values computed by a simple additive model. Such results from the standard solutions were confirmed by extending the study to atmospheric PM2.5 samples collected in winter in the Lombardia region, a hot spot for air pollution in northern Italy. This work highlights that a solid estimation of oxidative properties of ambient PM requires an interaction-based approach accounting for the interaction effects between metals and quinones.},

  abstract = {Artificial neural networks (ANNs) becomes very popular tool in hydrology, especially in rainfall-runoff modelling. However, a number of issues should be addressed to apply this technique to a particular problem in an efficient way, including selection of network type, its architecture, proper optimization algorithm and a method to deal with overfitting of the data. The present paper addresses the last, rarely considered issue, namely comparison of methods to prevent multi-layer perceptron neural networks from overfitting of the training data in the case of daily catchment runoff modelling. Among a number of methods to avoid overfitting the early stopping, the noise injection and the weight decay have been known for about two decades, however only the first one is frequently applied in practice. Recently a new methodology called optimized approximation algorithm has been proposed in the literature.Overfitting of the training data leads to deterioration of generalization properties of the model and results in its untrustworthy performance when applied to novel measurements. Hence the purpose of the methods to avoid overfitting is somehow contradictory to the goal of optimization algorithms, which aims at finding the best possible solution in parameter space according to pre-defined objective function and available data. Moreover, different optimization algorithms may perform better for simpler or larger ANN architectures. This suggest the importance of proper coupling of different optimization algorithms, ANN architectures and methods to avoid overfitting of real-world data - an issue that is also studied in details in the present paper.The study is performed for Annapolis River catchment, characterized by significant seasonal changes in runoff, rapid floods during winter and spring, moderately dry summers, severe winters with snowfall, snow melting, frequent freeze and thaw, and presence of river ice. The present paper shows that the elaborated noise injection method may prevent overfitting slightly better than the most popular early stopping approach. However, the implementation of noise injection to real-world problems is difficult and the final model performance depends significantly on a number of very technical details, what somehow limits its practical applicability. It is shown that optimized approximation algorithm does not improve the results obtained by older methods, possibly due to over-simplified criterion of stopping the algorithm. Extensive calculations reveal that Evolutionary Computation-based algorithm performs better for simpler ANN architectures, whereas classical gradient-based Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is able to benefit from additional input variables, representing precipitation and snow cover from one more previous day, and from more complicated ANN architectures. This confirms that the curse of dimensionality has severe impact on the performance of Evolutionary Computing methods. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Two multivariate mathematical models Positive Matrix Factorization and UNMIX - were applied to the measurement data, and identified seven “common” sources, which have similar compositions and similar fine mass contributions in both models. Two ensemble backward trajectory techniques - Potential Source Contribution Function and Residence-Time Analysis - are also applied to evaluate and interpret the mathematical model results. The trajectory techniques indicate a strong regional character to the upwind locations associated with high contributions identified independently by the mathematical techniques. These convergent results among the multiple methods provide a degree of confidence that each of the receptor methods can provide useful insights for air quality management, when applied to speciated fine particle data of this nature. Midwestern fuel combustion (with separate seasonal source characteristics), local Woodsmoke, and East Coast urban source influences collectively accounted for nearly 90\% of the average fine mass concentrations at the receptor. Smaller contributions were also identified from Canadian Smelters, Canadian motor vehicles (and/or other Mn sources), and windblown soil.},

During study period, PM10 concentrations were found in the range from 34.8 to 109.7ï¿½μg/m3 and from 32.3 to 137.3ï¿½μg/m3 at Jogannapalem and Parawada sites respectively. Chemical characterization of PM10 was carried out to estimate the concentration levels of various particle bound chemical species (Al, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Pb, Cd, Cl−, F-, NO3-, SO42−, Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+). Among different species, Al was observed to have highest average concentration (4.1ï¿½μg/m3 at Jogannapalem and 3.8ï¿½μg/m3 at Parawada) at both the sampling sites followed by K at Jogannapalem and Ca at Parawada. PM10 concentration as well as trace metals concentration (except Mn and Fe) was observed to have higher concentrations at Parawada site as compared to Jogannapalem site, indicating higher pollution at Parawada. Source apportionment study carried out using PMF (USEPA PMF5.0) receptor model identified six major sources at Jogannapalem and seven predominant sources at Parawada, which are contributing to collected PM. The two study locations share five common sources viz. crustal, sea salt spray, coal combustion, fuel oil combustion and metal industry. The other sources include biomass burning at Jogannapalem; road traffic and secondary aerosols at Parawada. At Jogannapalem, biomass burning (35\%) is the predominant source, whereas coal combustion (22.6\%) is dominating at Parawada. PMF factor profiles were observed to have similar elemental profiles obtained at different industrial locations of Visakhapatnam.},

There has been substantial progress in the evaluation of PM health effects at different time-scales of exposure and in the exploration of the shape of the concentration-response function. There has also been emerging evidence of PM-related cardiovascular health effects and growing knowledge regarding interconnected general pathophysiological pathways that link PM exposure with cardiopulmonary morbidity and mortality. Despite important gaps in scientific knowledge and continued reasons for some skepticism, a comprehensive evaluation of the research findings provides persuasive evidence that exposure to fine particulate air pollution has adverse effects on cardiopulmonary health.

  abstract = {Abstract. The aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM) is nowadays widely used to identify and quantify the main components of fine particles in ambient air. As such, its deployment at observatory platforms is fully incorporated within the European Aerosol, Clouds and Trace Gases Research Infrastructure (ACTRIS). Regular intercomparisons are organized at the Aerosol Chemical Monitoring Calibration Center (ACMCC; part of the European Center for Aerosol Calibration, Paris, France) to ensure the consistency of the dataset, as well as instrumental performance and variability. However, in situ quality assurance remains a fundamental aspect of the instrument's stability. Here, we present and discuss the main outputs of long-term quality assurance efforts achieved for ACSM measurements at the research station Melpitz (Germany) since 2012 onwards. In order to validate the ACSM measurements over the years and to characterize seasonal variations, nitrate, sulfate, ammonium, organic, and particle mass concentrations were systematically compared against the collocated measurements of daily offline high-volume PM1 and PM2.5 filter samples and particle number size distribution (PNSD) measurements. Mass closure analysis was made by comparing the total particle mass (PM) concentration obtained by adding the mass concentration of equivalent black carbon (eBC) from the multi-angle absorption photometer (MAAP) to the ACSM chemical composition, to that of PM1 and PM2.5 during filter weighing, as well as to the derived mass concentration of PNSD. A combination of PM1 and PM2.5 filter samples helped identifying the critical importance of the upper size cutoff of the ACSM during such exercises. The ACSM–MAAP-derived mass concentrations systematically deviated from the PM1 mass when the mass concentration of the latter represented less than 60\,\% of PM2.5, which was linked to the transmission efficiency of the aerodynamic lenses of the ACSM. The best correlations are obtained for sulfate (slope\,=0.96; R2=0.77) and total PM (slope\,=1.02; R2=0.90). Although, sulfate did not exhibit a seasonal dependency, total PM mass concentration revealed a small seasonal variability linked to the increase in non-water-soluble fractions. The nitrate suffers from a loss of ammonium nitrate during filter collection, and the contribution of organo-nitrate compounds to the ACSM nitrate signal make it difficult to directly compare the two methods. The contribution of m∕z~44 (f44) to the total organic mass concentration was used to convert the ACSM organic mass (OM) to organic carbon (OC) by using a similar approach as for the aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS). The resulting estimated OCACSM was compared with the measured OCPM1 (slope\,=0.74; R2=0.77), indicating that the f44 signal was relatively free of interferences during this period. The PM2.5 filter samples use for the ACSM data quality might suffer from a systematic bias due to a size truncation effect as well as to the presence of chemical species that cannot be detected by the ACSM in coarse mode (e.g., sodium nitrate and sodium sulfate). This may lead to a systematic underestimation of the ACSM particle mass concentration and/or a positive artifact that artificially decreases the discrepancies between the two methods. Consequently, ACSM data validation using PM2.5 filters has to be interpreted with extreme care. The particle mass closure with the PNSD was satisfying (slope\,=0.77; R2=0.90 over the entire period), with a slight overestimation of the mobility particle size spectrometer (MPSS)-derived mass concentration in winter. This seasonal variability was related to a change on the PNSD and a larger contribution of the supermicrometer particles in winter. This long-term analysis between the ACSM and other collocated instruments confirms the robustness of the ACSM and its suitability for long-term measurements. Particle mass closure with the PNSD is strongly recommended to ensure the stability of the ACSM. A near-real-time mass closure procedure within the entire ACTRIS–ACSM network certainly represents an optimal quality control and assurance of both warranting the quality assurance of the ACSM measurements as well as identifying cross-instrumental biases.},

  abstract = {A high-resolution sulfate record from a Col du Dôme (CDD, 4250 m above sea level, French Alps) ice core was used to investigate the impact of growing SO2 emissions on the midtroposphere sulfate levels over Europe since 1925. The large annual snow accumulation rate at the CDD site permits examination of the summer and winter sulfate trends separately. Being close to 80 ± 10 ng g-1 in preindustrial summer ice, sulfate CDD summer levels then increase at a mean rate of 6 ng g-1 per year from 1925 to 1960. From 1960 to 1980 the increase continued at a rate of 24 ng g-1 per year. Concentrations reach a maximum of 860 ng g-1 in 1980 and subsequently decrease to 600 ng g-1 in the 1990s. These summer sulfate changes closely follow the course of growing SO2 emissions from source regions located within 700-1000 km around the Alps (France, Italy, Spain, and to a lesser extent, former West Germany). In winter the CDD sulfate levels are 3 to 8 times lower than in summer because of more limited upward transport of air masses from the boundary layer at that season. Being close to 20 ng g-1 in the preindustrial ice, winter levels were regularly enhanced at a mean annual rate of 1.2 ng g-1 from 1925 to 1980. The weak winter change from the preindustrial era to 1980 (a factor of 4 instead of 10 in summer) reflects a limited contamination of the free troposphere which, in contrast to summer, occurs at a larger scale (total Europe/former USSR). Intimately connected to Europe, these long-term changes in the Alps clearly differ in time and amplitude with the ones revealed by Greenland ice cores which indicate an increase by a factor of 3 between 1880 and 1970 in relation with long-range transport of pollutants from Eurasia as well as from North America. Furthermore, because of a lower natural contribution to the total sulfate level the anthropogenic changes can be more accurately derived in the Alps than in Greenland. Using the observed relationship between present-day concentrations in air and snowpack, the CDD ice core record permits reconstruction of present and past atmospheric sulfate concentrations at 4300 m above sea level over Europe in summer and winter. These data are compared with the sulfate levels simulated by current global sulfur models at 600 hPa for which uncertainties still range within a factor of 2. Together with observations made at lower elevation in the early 1990s the atmospheric levels derived for the CDD site (∼ 20 and 400 ng m-3 STP in winter and summer, respectively) documente the vertical sulfate distribution between the ground and 4300 m elevation over western Europe at that time. In this way, data gained at high-elevation Alpine sites are powerful in evaluating the recent role of sulfate aerosol in forcing the climate over Europe.

  abstract = {During a field campaign performed at 4360 m elevation in the French Alps in summer 2004, atmospheric levels of acidic gases (HCOOH, CH3COOH, HNO3, HCl, and SO2) and related aerosol species were investigated using mist chamber and denuder tube samplings. Sulfate aerosol levels greatly exceeded those of gaseous SO2. Conversely, chloride, nitrate and particularly monocarboxylates were much more present in the gas phase than in the aerosol phase. On a molar basis, formic and acetic acids are the most abundant acidic gases (∼14 nmol m-3 STP), followed by nitric acid (7 nmol m-3 STP), hydrochloric acid (1.7 nmol, m-3 STP) and sulfur dioxide (0.8 nmol m-3 STP). These data gained in the free troposphere over Europe in summer are discussed and compared to those obtained during aircraft missions conducted over North America and the northwest Pacific near China. It is concluded that the concentrations of acidic gases and related aerosol species are quite similar in the free troposphere in summer over Europe and North America. Concentrations of sulfur and nitrogen species in the free troposphere are lower over Europe (and North America) than over the Pacific region located near China (a factor 5 and 2, respectively). Finally, measurements achieved in this study tend to indicate that secondary production is important for the atmospheric budget of carboxylic acids.

The measured 24-h average PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations at different locations were found between 134.7 and 257.7 μg/m3 and 78.7–121.1 μg/m3, respectively. The 24-h average PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations at the study sites were exceeding the national (NAAQS) and WHO limits by more than 1.3 and 3 times, respectively. The PM mass was enriched with carbonaceous matter, ions, crustal and trace elements and their concentrations (except, Sr, Ni, S, As, V, Sb, Ga- the trace elements associated with coal and heavy oil combustion \& NO3 - due to high nitrate formation ability at greater heights) were found higher in LE. The source apportionment study was performed with positive matrix factorisation (PMF). PMF analysis identified vehicular emission (PM10, 9.6–24.3\% \& PM2.5, 12.1–25.3\%), secondary inorganics (PM10, 6.4–22.5\% \& PM2.5, 11–23\%), crustal source (PM10, 9–52\% \& PM2.5, 3.8–10.7\%), fuel oil combustion (PM10, 3–21\% \& PM2.5, 9–23\%), biomass burning (PM10, 7.4–28.6\% \& PM2.5, 6–50.5\%), and coal combustion (PM10, 13–17\% \& PM2.5, 14–19.1\%) as the main sources of PM10 and PM2.5 at the study sites. A significant difference in source contribution between the elevations was observed for coal combustion, fuel oil combustion, biomass burning, and crustal sources. The contribution of vehicular emission and secondary inorganics estimates were broadly similar at both elevations. Coal and fuel oil combustion contribution was found relatively higher at HE. Further, health risk due to exposure to toxic heavy metals in PM2.5 was assessed. Non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks (averaged of four sites) for both children and adults were exceeding the acceptable limit by more than 1.13 times. Results also showed that the public residing at HE is more susceptible to have greater health risks than LE at Delhi city. Sources contribution to carcinogenic risk was assessed and the results indicated that coal combustion (41\%) contribution was highest followed by crustal sources (22\%), fuel oil combustion (17\%), vehicular emission (12\%), biomass burning (4\%) and secondary inorganics (4\%).},

In this paper, we first provide a literature review on the parameters' influence on the prediction performance and on variable importance measures. It is well known that in most cases RF works reasonably well with the default values of the hyperparameters specified in software packages. Nevertheless, tuning the hyperparameters can improve the performance of RF. In the second part of this paper, after a presenting brief overview of tuning strategies, we demonstrate the application of one of the most established tuning strategies, model-based optimization (MBO). To make it easier to use, we provide the tuneRanger R package that tunes RF with MBO automatically. In a benchmark study on several datasets, we compare the prediction performance and runtime of tuneRanger with other tuning implementations in R and RF with default hyperparameters.

The real-time hourly averaged OP (based on a dithiothreitol assay) and PM2.5 chemical composition were measured intermittently from October 2019 to January 2020. The peak extrinsic OP (OPv: normalized by the volume of air) was observed during the winter fog (WFOG) (5.23 ± 4.6 nmol·min−1·m−3), whereas the intrinsic OP (OPm; normalized by the PM2.5 mass) was the highest during the Diwali fireworkinfluenced period (29.4 ± 18.48 pmol·min−1·μg−1). Source apportionment analysis using positive matrix factorization revealed that traffic + resuspended dust-related emissions (39\%) and secondary sulfate + oxidized organic aerosols (38\%) were driving the OPv during the PMON period, whereas BURN aerosols dominated (37\%) the OPv during the WFOG period. Firework-related emissions became a significant contributor (∼32\%) to the OPv during the Diwali period (4 day period from October 26 to 29), and its contribution peaked (72\%) on the night of Diwali. Discerning the influence of seasonal and episodic sources on health-relevant properties of PM2.5, such as OP, could help better understand the causal relationships between PM2.5 and health effects in India.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS), combined with statistical methods such as positive matrix factorization (PMF), has greatly advanced the quantification of primary organic aerosol (POA) sources and total secondary organic aerosol (SOA) mass. However, the use of thermal vaporization and electron ionization yields extensive thermal decomposition and ionization-induced fragmentation, which limit chemical information needed for SOA source apportionment. The recently developed extractive electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (EESI-TOF) provides mass spectra of the organic aerosol fraction with a linear response to mass and no thermal decomposition or ionization-induced fragmentation. However, the costs and operational requirements of online instruments make their use impractical for long-term or spatially dense monitoring applications. This challenge was overcome for AMS measurements by measuring re-nebulized water extracts from ambient filter samples. Here, we apply the same strategy for EESI-TOF measurements of 1~year of 24\,h filter samples collected approximately every fourth day throughout 2013 at an urban site. The nebulized water extracts were measured simultaneously with an AMS. The application of positive matrix factorization (PMF) to EESI-TOF spectra resolved seven factors, which describe water-soluble OA: less and more aged biomass burning aerosol (LABBEESI and MABBEESI, respectively), cigarette-smoke-related organic aerosol, primary biological organic aerosol, biogenic secondary organic aerosol, and a summer mixed oxygenated organic aerosol factor. Seasonal trends and relative contributions of the EESI-TOF OA sources were compared with AMS source apportionment factors, measured water-soluble ions, cellulose, and meteorological data. Cluster analysis was utilized to identify key factor-specific ions based on PMF. Both LABB and MABB contribute strongly during winter. LABB is distinguished by very high signals from C6H10O5 (levoglucosan and isomers) and C8H12O6, whereas MABB is characterized by a large number of CxHyOz and CxHyOzN species of two distinct populations: one with low H:C and high O:C and the other with high H:C and low O:C. Two oxygenated summertime SOA sources were attributed to terpene-derived biogenic SOA, a major summertime aerosol source in central Europe. Furthermore, a primary biological organic aerosol factor was identified, which was dominated by plant-derived fatty acids and correlated with free cellulose. The cigarette-smoke-related factor contained a high contribution of nicotine and high abundance of organic nitrate ions with low m∕z.},

The basic fractionation mechanism is proposed to be a large contribution of aggregated clay minerals (having low \%/Al) to the total Si and Al of aerosols. For urban areas fly ash and anthropogenic dusts may also affect Si/Al. Accurate calculation of the crustal contribution to the aerosol must therefore be referred to crustal aerosol, whose composition is not yet known, rather than to the traditional average crust.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The measurement of elements in PM10 was performed with 1\,h time resolution at a rural freeway site during summer 2015 in Switzerland using the Xact1~625 Ambient Metals Monitor. On average the Xact elements (without accounting for oxygen and other associated elements) make up about 20\,\% of the total PM10 mass (14.6\,µg\,m−3). We conducted source apportionment by positive matrix factorisation (PMF) of the elemental mass measurable by the Xact (i.e. major elements heavier than Al), defined here as PM10el. Eight different sources were identified in PM10el (elemental PM10) mass driven by the sum of 14 elements (notable elements in brackets): Fireworks-I (K, S, Ba and Cl), Fireworks-II (K), sea salt (Cl), secondary sulfate (S), background dust (Si, Ti), road dust (Ca), non-exhaust traffic-related elements (Fe) and industrial elements (Zn and Pb). The major components were secondary sulfate and non-exhaust traffic-related elements followed by background dust and road dust factors, explaining 21\,\%, 20\,\%, 18\,\% and 16\,\% of the analysed PM10 elemental mass, respectively, with the factor mass not corrected for oxygen content. Further, there were minor contributions (on the order of a few percent) of sea salt and industrial sources. The regionally influenced secondary sulfate factor showed negligible resuspension, and concentrations were similar throughout the day. The significant loads of the non-exhaust traffic-related and road dust factors with strong diurnal variations highlight the continuing importance of vehicle-related air pollutants at this site. Enhanced control of PMF implemented via the SourceFinder software (SoFi Pro version 6.2, PSI, Switzerland) allowed for a successful apportionment of transient sources such as the two firework factors and sea salt, which remained mixed when analysed by unconstrained PMF.},

  abstract = {New approaches to solving the factor analysis (FA) problem have recently been developed by recognizing that factor analysis is fundamentally a least-squares (LS) problem. This approach is called Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF). Two programs have been written to implement different algorithms for solving the problem. These programs are PMF2 and Multilinear Engine (ME-2). The two programs use different algorithms to obtain the least-squares solution and the constraints are imposed in different ways. Elemental composition data for particle samples collected in Phoenix, AZ from June 1996 through June 1998, were used to compare the source apportionment of these two programs. The ME-2 results presented in this paper are compared with the previously published PMF2 results. The identification of the eight PMF sources returned one questionable source: wood burning and some peculiar mass contributions. The extra features of ME-2 made it possible to also investigate the sources responsible for the fine particles. The mixed-way approach indicated the existence of incinerators in the Phoenix area. Like PMF, ME-2 identified high source contributions for biomass burning, motor vehicles (with higher contribution in winter), coal-fired power plants (secondary particles with higher contributions in summer), soil, and nonferrous smelting process. Sea salt and heavy-duty diesel were identified by the ME two-way analysis, but they disappeared in the threeway analysis of the dual fine particle sequential sampler (DFPSS) and DICHOT data. Instead, an obvious incinerator source was identified again. Thus, PMF and ME-2 identified the same major sources responsible for the PM2.5 in Phoenix, but some of the sources identified by PMF2 appear to be uncertain. The three-way analysis provided additional information about possible sources, but also returned unexplainable sources.},

Understanding the biological action of PM is of particular importance in improvement of public health. Recent Advances: Both fine (PM {$<$}2.5 μM) and ultrafine particles ({$<$}0.1 μM) are widely believed to mediate their effects through redox regulated pathways. A rather simplistic graded ramp model of redox stress has been replaced by a more sophisticated understanding of the role of oxidative stress in signaling, and the realization that many of the observed effects may involve disruption and/or enhancement of normal endogenous redox signaling and induction of a potent immune-mediated response, through entrainment of multiple reactive oxygen species (ROS). Critical Issues: The molecular events by which pulmonary oxidative stress in response to inhalational exposure to air pollution triggers inflammation, major ROS (e.g., superoxide, hydroxyl radical, nitric oxide, and peroxynitrite) generated in air pollution exposure, types of oxidative tissue damage in target organs, contributions of nonimmune and immune cells in inflammation, and the role of protective proteins (e.g., surfactant, proteins, and antioxidants) are highly complex and may differ depending on models and concomitant disease states. Future Directions: While the role of oxidative stress in the lung has been well demonstrated, the role of oxidative stress in mediating systemic effects especially in inflammation and injury processes needs further work. The role of antioxidant defenses with chronic exposure will also need further exploration. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 28, 797-818.},

These questions are interesting to practitioners as well as theoreticians, because the small-sample effects can easily contaminate the design and evaluation of a proposed system. For applications with a large number of features and a complex classification rule, the training sample size must be quite large. A large test sample is required to accurately evaluate a classifier with a low error rate. The design of a pattern recognition system consists of several stages: Data collection, formation of the pattern classes, feature selection, specification of the classification algorithm, and estimation of the classification error. In this paper, we will discuss the effects of sample size on feature selection and error estimation for several types of classifier. In addition to surveying prior work in this area, our emphasis is on giving practical advice to today's designers and users of statistical pattern recognition systems. © 1991 IEEE},

  abstract = {Mean annual biomass burning contributions to the bulk particulate matter (PM X) load were quantified in a southern-European urban environment (Barcelona, Spain) with special attention to typical Mediterranean winter and summer conditions. In spite of the complexity of the local air pollution cocktail and the expected low contribution of biomass burning emissions to PM levels in Southern Europe, the impact of these emissions was detected at an urban background site by means of tracers such as levoglucosan, K + and organic carbon (OC). The significant correlation between levoglucosan and OC (r 2=0.77) and K + (r 2=0.65), as well as a marked day/night variability of the levoglucosan levels and levoglucosan/OC ratios was indicative of the contribution from regional scale biomass burning emissions during night-time transported by land breezes. In addition, on specific days (21-22 March), the contribution from long-range transported biomass burning aerosols was detected.Quantification of the contribution of biomass burning aerosols to PM levels on an annual basis was possible by means of the Multilinear Engine (ME). Biomass burning emissions accounted for 3\% of PM 10 and PM 2.5 (annual mean), while this percentage increased up to 5\% of PM 1. During the winter period, regional-scale biomass burning emissions (agricultural waste burning) were estimated to contribute with 7±4\% of PM 2.5 aerosols during night-time (period when emissions were clearly detected). Long-range transported biomass burning aerosols (possibly from forest fires and/or agricultural waste burning) accounted for 5±2\% of PM 2.5 during specific episodes. Annually, biomass burning emissions accounted for 19\%-21\% of OC levels in PM 10, PM 2.5 and PM 1. The contribution of this source to K + ranged between 48\% for PM 10 and 97\% for PM 1 (annual mean). Results for K + from biomass burning evidenced that this tracer is mostly emitted in the fine fraction, and thus coarse K + could not be taken as an appropriate tracer of biomass burning. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

For example, few studies document why some species were used and others not used in the modeling, how the number of factors was selected, or how much uncertainty exists in the solutions. More thorough documentation will aid the development of standard protocols for analyzing PM data with PMF and will reveal more clearly where research is needed to help future analysts select from the various possible procedures and parameters available in PMF. For example, research likely is needed to determine optimal approaches for handling data below detection limits, ways to apportion PM mass among sources identified by PMF, and ways to estimate uncertainties in the solution.

Trace elements can act as indicators for the identification of sources of particulate matter {$<$}10 μm (PM10) in ambient air. Receptor modeling was performed with positive matrix factorization (PMF) for trace element data from an urban background site in Zürich, Switzerland. Eight different sources were identified for the three examined size ranges (PM1-0.1, PM2.5-1 and PM 10-2.5): secondary sulfate, wood combustion, fire works, road traffic, mineral dust, de-icing salt, industrial and local anthropogenic activities. The major component was secondary sulfate for the smallest size range; the road traffic factor was found in all three size ranges. This trace element analysis is complemented with data from an Aerodyne high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS), assessing the PM1 fraction of organic aerosols. A separate PMF analysis revealed three factors related to three of the sources found with the RDI: oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA, related to inorganic secondary sulfate), hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol (HOA, related to road traffic) and biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA), explaining 60 \%, 22 \% and 17 \% of total measured organics, respectively. Since different compounds are used for the source classification, a higher percentage of the ambient PM10 mass concentration can be apportioned to sources by the combination of both methods. © 2011 Author(s).},

This included examining the differences in the magnitude of the individual source contributions as well as the correlation between the contribution values from the two methods. The results showed that both models predicted sulfates, nitrates and motor vehicles as the three highest fine particle contributors for the two sites accounting for approximately 80\% of the total. The PMF model attributed a slightly greater amount of fine particulate to the road salt, steel and soil sources while vegetative burning contributed more in the CMB results. Correlations between the contribution results from the two models were high for sulfates, nitrates and road salt with very good correlations existing for motor vehicles and petroleum refineries.

  abstract = {Fugitive dust from the erosion of arid and fallow land, after harvest and during agricultural activities, can at times be the dominant source of airborne particulate matter. In order to assess the source contributions to a given site, chemical mass balance (CMB) modeling is typically used together with source-specific profiles for organic and inorganic constituents. Yet, the mass balance closure can be achieved only if emission profiles for all major sources are considered. While a higher degree of mass balance closure has been achieved by adding individual organic marker compounds to elements, ions, EC, and organic carbon (OC), major source profiles for fugitive dust are not available. Consequently, neither the exposure of the population living near fugitive dust sources from farm land, nor its chemical composition is known. Surface soils from crop fields are enriched in plant detritus from both above and below ground plant parts; therefore, surface soil dust contains natural organic compounds from the crops and soil microbiota. Here, surface soils derived from fields growing cotton, safflower, tomato, almonds, and grapes have been analyzed for more than 180 organic compounds, including natural lipids, saccharides, pesticides, herbicides, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). The major result of this study is that selective biogenically derived organic compounds are suitable markers of fugitive dust from major agricultural crop fields in the San Joaquin Valley. Aliphatic homologs exhibit the typical biogenic signatures of epicuticular plant waxes and are therefore indicative of fugitive dust emissions and mechanical abrasion of wax protrusions from leaf surfaces. Saccharides, among which a- and b-glucose, sucrose, and mycose show the highest concentrations in surface soils, have been proposed to be generic markers for fugitive dust from cultivated land. Similarly, steroids are strongly indicative of fugitive dust. Yet, triterpenoids reveal the most pronounced distribution differences for all types of cultivated soils examined here and are by themselves powerful markers for fugitive dust that allow differentiation between the types of crops cultivated. PAHs are also found in some surface soils, as well as persistent pesticides, e.g., DDE, Fosfall, and others. r 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Black carbon (BC) particles produced by incomplete combustion of biomass and fossil fuels warm the atmosphere and decrease the reflectivity of snow and ice, hastening their melt. Although the significance of BC in Arctic climate change is widely acknowledged, observations on its deposition and sources are few. We present BC source types in a 300‐year (1700–2005) Svalbard ice core by analysis of particle‐bound organic compounds, radiocarbon, and trace elements. According to the radiocarbon results, 58\% of the deposited elemental carbon (EC, thermal‐optical proxy of BC) is of non‐fossil origin throughout the record, while the organic compounds suggest a higher percentage (68\%). The contribution of fossil fuels to EC is suggested to have been elevated between 1860 and 1920, particularly based on the organics and trace element data. A second increase in fossil fuel sources seems to have occurred near the end of the record: according to radiocarbon measurements between 1960 and 1990, while the organics and trace element data suggest that the contribution of fossil fuels has increased since the 1970s to the end of the record, along with observed increasing EC deposition. Modeled atmospheric transport between 1948 and 2004 shows that increasing EC deposition observed at the glacier during that period can be associated with increased atmospheric transport from Far East Asia. Further observational BC source data are essential to help target climate change mitigation efforts. The combination of robust radiocarbon with organic compound analyses requiring low sample amounts seems a promising approach for comprehensive Arctic BC source apportionment.           ,              Plain Language Summary                            Black carbon (BC) is a fine particulate emission component formed in natural and anthropogenic combustion of biomass and fossil fuels. BC effectively warms the atmosphere, and when it is deposited on snow and ice, it hastens their melt. BC strongly amplifies Arctic climate change but information on its deposition variations and sources are still very scarce. We studied sources of BC in a Svalbard (high‐Arctic) ice core covering the years 1700–2005 by analysis of chemical compounds, radiocarbon and trace elements. We found that throughout the ice core, the contribution of biomass combustion to BC was higher (ca. 60\%               –               70\%) than that of fossil fuels. The contribution of fossil fuel sources to BC in the ice core was elevated in 1860–1920, and again at the end of the record starting in the 1960s–1970s. Atmospheric transport modeling shows that increasing BC deposition observed at the glacier since the 1970s was associated with airmasses arriving increasingly from Far East Asia. Further observations on Arctic BC sources are essential to inform decision makers on which BC emissions most affect Arctic climate change.                        ,              Key Points                                                                Non‐fossil sources have dominated (ca. 60\%–70\%) elemental carbon (EC) deposition in a Svalbard ice core between 1700 and 2005                                                     The contribution of fossil fuels to EC was highest between 1860 and 1920 and toward the end of the record starting in the 1960s or 1970s                                                     Atmospheric transport modeling indicates that observed increased EC deposition was associated with potential Asian sources in 1948–2004},

  abstract = {A major fraction of fine particle matter consists of organic carbon (OC) but its origin is still inadequately known. In this study the sources of OC were investigated in the northern European urban environment in Helsinki, Finland. Measurements were carried out over one year and they included both filter (PM1) and online methods. From the filter samples OC, elemental carbon (EC), water-soluble OC (WSOC), levoglucosan and major ions were analyzed. Filter data together with the concentrations of inorganic gases were analyzed by Positive matrix factorization (PMF) in order to find the sources of OC (and WSOC) on an annual as well as on a seasonal basis. In order to study the diurnal variation of sources, OC and EC were measured by a semicontinuous OC/EC analyzer and major ions were determined by a Particle-into-Liquid Sampler coupled to ion chromatographs. According to PMF, OC concentrations were impacted by four sources: biomass combustion, traffic, long-range transport and secondary production. On an annual basis the OC concentration was dominated by secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Its contribution to OC was as high as 64\% in summer, which besides anthropogenic sources may also result from the large biogenic volatile organic carbon (VOC) emissions in the boreal region. In winter biomass combustion constituted the largest fraction in OC due to domestic wood combustion for heating purposes. Traffic contributed to OC from 15 to 27\%. Regarding the diurnal variation, the contribution from traffic was higher from 08:00 to 18:00 on weekdays than on weekends. The contribution from long-range transport to OC was 24\% on average. All four sources also influenced the WSOC concentrations, however, the contribution of SOA was significantly larger for WSOC than OC.},

The measurement campaign in the residential area was conducted in winter–spring 2019, whereas in the street canyon the measurements were carried out in autumn 2015. The sources of BC were explored by using positive matrix factorization (PMF) for the organic and refractory black carbon (rBC) mass spectra collected with a soot particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SP-AMS). Based on the PMF analysis, two sites had different local BC sources; the largest fraction of BC originated from biomass burning at the residential site (38 \%) and from the vehicular emissions in the street canyon (57 \%). Also, the mass size distribution of BC diverged at the sites as BC from traffic was found at the particle size of ∼ 100–150 nm whereas BC from biomass combustion was detected at ∼ 300 nm. At both sites, a large fraction of BC was associated with urban background or long-range-transported BC indicated by the high oxidation state of organics related to those PMF factors.},

  abstract = {An emerging hypothesis in the field of air pollution is that oxidative stress is one of the important pathways leading to adverse health effects of airborne particulate matter (PM). To advance our understanding of sources and chemical elements contributing to aerosol oxidative potential and provide global comparative data, we report here on the biological oxidative potential associated with size-segregated airborne PM in different urban areas of the world, measured by a biological (cell-based) reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay. Our synthesis indicates a generally greater intrinsic PM oxidative potential as well as higher levels of exposure to redox-active PM in developing areas of the world. Moreover, on the basis of our observations, smaller size fractions are generally associated with higher intrinsic ROS activity compared with larger PM size fractions. Another important outcome of our study is the identification of major species and sources that are associated with ROS activity. Water-soluble transition metals (e.g., Fe, Ni, Cu, Cr, Mn, Zn and V) and water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) showed consistent correlations with the oxidative potential of airborne PM across different urban areas and size ranges. The major PM sources associated with these chemical species include residual/fuel oil combustion, traffic emissions, and secondary organic aerosol formation, indicating that these sources are major drivers of PM-induced oxidative potential. Moreover, comparison of ROS activity levels across different seasons indicated that photochemical aging increases the intrinsic oxidative potential of airborne PM.},

Here, the OP of selected bioaerosols (bacteria cells vs fungal spores) was assessed through the cell-free DTT assay. Results show that bioaerosols induce Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production, varying along the microorganism type, species, and concentration. Fungal spores show up to 10 times more ROS generation than bacterial cells. At the highest concentrations, fungal spores present as much oxidative reactivity as the most redox-Active airborne chemicals (Copper, Naphtoquinone). Moreover, bioaerosols substantially influence OP of ambient PM and that of its chemical constituents: in presence of A. fumigatus spores, the OP of Cu/NQ is increased by a factor of 2 to 5, whereas, 104 and 105 S. epidermidis bacterial cells.mL-1 halves the OP of Cu/NQ. Finally, viable and gamma-rays-killed model bioaerosols present similar oxidative reactivity, suggesting a metabolism-independent cellular mechanism. These results reveal the importance of bioaerosols for PM reactivity. PM toxicity can be modified due to bioaerosols contribution or by their ability to modulate the OP of toxic chemicals present in PM.},

This work improves our understanding of the spatial behavior and distribution of these chemical species and evidences their major effective environmental drivers. We conducted a large study focusing on the daily (24 h) PM10 SC concentrations for 16 increasing space scale sites (local to nationwide), over at least 1 complete year. These sites are distributed in several French geographic areas of different environmental conditions. Our analyses, mainly based on the examination of the short-term evolutions of SC concentrations, clearly show distance-dependent correlations. SC concentration evolutions are highly synchronous at an urban city scale and remain well correlated throughout the same geographic re-gions, even if the sites are situated in different cities. However, sampling sites located in two distinct geographic areas are poorly correlated. Such a pattern indicates that the processes responsible for the evolution of the atmospheric SC concentrations present a spatial homogeneity over typical areas of at least tens of kilometers. Local phenomena, such as the resuspension of topsoil and associated microbiota, do no account for the major emissions processes of SC in urban areas not directly influenced by agricultural activities. The concentrations of SC and cellulose display remarkably synchronous temporal evolution cycles at an urban site in Grenoble, indicating a common source ascribed to vegetation. Additionally, higher concentrations of SC at another site located in a crop field region occur during each harvest periods, indicating resuspension processes of plant materials (crop detritus, leaf debris) and associated microbiota for agricultural and nearby urbanized areas. Finally, ambient air temperature, relative humidity, and vegetation density constitute the main effective drivers of SC atmospheric concentrations.},

  abstract = {A growing number of studies are using specific primary sugar species, such as sugar alcohols or primary saccharides, as marker compounds to characterize and apportion primary biogenic organic aerosols (PBOAs) in the atmosphere. To better understand their annual cycles, as well as their spatiotemporal abundance in terms of concentrations and sources, we conducted a large study focusing on three major atmospheric primary sugar compounds (i.e., arabitol, mannitol, and glucose) measured in various environmental conditions for about 5300 filter samples collected at 28 sites in France. Our results show significant atmospheric concentrations of polyols (defined here as the sum of arabitol and mannitol) and glucose at each sampling location, highlighting their ubiquity. Results also confirm that polyols and glucose are mainly associated with the coarse rather than the fine aerosol mode. At nearly all sites, atmospheric concentrations of polyols and glucose display a well-marked seasonal pattern, with maximum concentrations from late spring to early autumn, followed by an abrupt decrease in late autumn, and a minimum concentration during wintertime. Such seasonal patterns support biogenic emissions associated with higher biological metabolic activities (sporulation, growth, etc.) during warmer periods. Results from a previous comprehensive study using positive matrix factorization (PMF) based on an extended aerosol chemical composition dataset of up to 130 species for 16 of the same sample series have also been used in the present work. The polyols-to-PMPBOA ratio is 0.024±0.010 on average for all sites, with no clear distinction between traffic, urban, or rural typology. Overall, even if the exact origin of the PBOA source is still under investigation, it appears to be an important source of particulate matter (PM), especially during summertime. Results also show that PBOAs are significant sources of total organic matter (OM) in PM10 (13±4\% on a yearly average, and up to 40\% in some environments in summer) at most of the investigated sites. The mean PBOA chemical profile is clearly dominated by contribution from OM (78±9\% of the mass of the PBOA PMF on average), and only a minor contribution from the dust class (3±4\%), suggesting that ambient polyols are most likely associated with biological particle emissions (e.g., active spore discharge) rather than soil dust resuspension.},

This study presents the first comprehensive description of the structure and main sources of airborne microbial communities associated with temporal trends in Sugar Compounds (SC) concentrations of PM10 in 3 sites under a climatic gradient in France. By combining sugar chemistry and DNA Metabarcoding approaches, we intended to identify PM10-associated microbial communities and their main sources at three sampling-sites in France, under different climates, during the summer of 2018. This study accounted also for the interannual variability in summer airborne microbial community structure (bacteria and fungi only) associated with PM10-SC concentrations during a 2 consecutive years’ survey at one site. Our results showed that temporal changes in PM10-SC in the three sites are associated with the abundance of only a few specific taxa of airborne fungi and bacterial. These taxa differ significantly between the 3 climatic regions studied. The microbial communities structure associated with SC concentrations of PM10 during a consecutive 2-year study remained stable in the rural area. Atmospheric concentration levels of PM10-SC species varied significantly between the 3 study sites, but with no clear difference according to site typology (rural vs. urban), suggesting that SC emissions are related to regional rather than local climatic characteristics. The overall microbial beta diversity in PM10 samples is significantly different from that of the main vegetation around the urban sites studied. This indicates that the airborne microorganisms at these urban sites are not solely from the immediate surrounding vegetation, which contrasts with observations at the scale of a regionally homogeneous rural site in 2017. These results improve our understanding of the spatial behavior of tracers of PBOA emission sources, which need to be better characterized to further implement this important mass fraction of Organic Matter (OM) in Chemical Transport models (CTM).},

  abstract = {The inorganic and organic geochemistry of aerosol particulate matter (APM) was studied in a major olive grove area from Southwest Europe (Baena, Spain). The biomass consists of olive tree branches and the solid waste resulting of the olive oil production. Moreover, high PM10 levels were obtained (31.5 μg m− 3), with two days of exceedance of the daily limit of 50 μg m− 3 (2008/50/CE; EU, 2008) during the experimental period. A high mean levoglucosan concentration was obtained representing up 95\% of the total mass of the isomers analysed (280 ng m− 3), while galactosan and mannosan mean concentrations were lower (8.64 ng m− 3 and 7.86 ng m− 3, respectively). The contribution of wood smoke in Baena was estimated, representing 19\% of OC and 17\% of OM total mass. Positive matrix factor (PMF) was applied to the organic and inorganic aerosols data, which has permitted the identification of five source categories: biomass burning, traffic, mineral dust, marine aerosol and SIC (secondary inorganic compounds). The biomass burning category reached the highest mean contribution to the PM10 mass (41\%, 17.6 μg m− 3). In light of these results, the use of biomass resulting from the olive oil production for residential heating and industry must be considered the most important aerosol source during the winter months. The results of this paper can be extrapolated to other olive oil producing areas in the Mediterranean basin. Therefore, a fuller understanding of this type of biomass combustion is required in order to be able to establish appropriate polices and reduce the environmental impact on the population.},

  abstract = {The most important function of the placenta is the exchange of nutrients and oxygen between a mother and her fetus. To establish a healthy functioning placenta, placentation needs to occur with adequate remodelling of spiral arteries by extravillous trophoblasts. When this process is impaired, the resulting suboptimal and inadequate placenta function results in the manifestation of pregnancy complications. Impaired placenta function can cause preeclampsia and leads to fetal growth restriction due to hypoxia. Presence of hypoxia leads to oxidative stress due to an imbalance between reactive oxygen species and antioxidants, thereby causing damage to proteins, lipids and DNA. In the placenta, signs of morphological adaptation in response to hypoxia can be found. Different placental lesions like maternal or fetal vascular malperfusion or chronic villitis lead to a decreased exchange of oxygen between the mother and the fetus. Clinically, several biomarkers indicative for oxidative stress, e.g. malondialdehyde and reduced levels of free thiols are found. This review aims to give an overview of the causes and (potential) role of placental oxidative stress in the development of placental parenchymal pathology and its clinical consequences. Also, therapeutic options aiming at prevention or treatment of hypoxia of the placenta and fetus are described.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Preclinical animal studies have established stressors, substance use associated cues, and priming as distinct triggers of relapse in substance dependence. These triggers seem to induce relapse by activating distinct brain pathways. In order to test these findings in humans, it is necessary to establish new human research paradigms. Neuroimaging may help to study brain regions involved in mediating the effects of these distinct triggers of relapse and to further delineate mediators of these pathways. In order to understand individual differences it is crucial to assess the impact of moderators on these pathways to relapse. METHODS: Paradigms to study distinct relapse triggers are currently being set up for tobacco dependence. It is practically impossible to study human relapse and specifically its neurobiological pathways in the natural surrounding. Instead we aim to establish vulnerability patterns in a laboratory environment, applying functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) assessments during trigger exposure. Brain activation determined by fMRI may constitute a sensitive measure to assess responses to cues, stress, and priming. Establishing these paradigms will then allow to further delineate the role of possible mediators (e.g. attention, inhibition) and moderators (e.g. sex, genetic factors) underlying relapse to smoking. RESULTS: Initial results are encouraging, but this approach needs further studies to proof its usefulness. CONCLUSIONS: We outline an approach to study nicotine relapse within a laboratory environment, using fMRI assessments during trigger exposure. The long term goal is rational treatment development. To reach this goal it is crucial to identify, include and investigate critical moderators and mediators of relapse within this approach.},

  abstract = {A source apportionment study was carried out at four sites in Emilia-Romagna region, southern Po Valley, one of the most critical regions in Europe in terms of atmospheric pollution. PM2.5 daily samples were collected during 4 years from April 2013 to October 2017 at one rural site (San Pietro Capofiume) and three urban background locations in the cities of Bologna, Rimini, Parma which show different features and are located in the central, coastal and inner part of the investigated region. Samples were analyzed to achieve a complete chemical characterization (carbon fractions, ions, and elements). A source apportionment analysis by Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) was performed and 6 PM2.5 factors were identified at all sites but the rural one (where 5 out of 6 of them were detected); the factors were associated to traffic with dust resuspension, biomass burning, oil combustion/ship emission, mix anthropogenic (not found at the rural site), ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate with organics. Chemical profiles of factors were very similar among all the 4 sites, indicating that main pollution sources are basically the same at the 4 sites, while some differences emerged with regard to source contributions. Factors related to secondary components seem to explain almost 50\% or even more of PM2.5 mass concentration in all seasons. Traffic and biomass burning are the most relevant contributors to PM2.5 in terms of primary components. A not negligible contribution of biomass burning results in Rimini during the summer, suggesting other possible sources of wood combustion, such as cooking or open burning of agricultural pruning bonfires. Agriculture is not singled out as a PMF factor, but a rough estimate based on ammonium concentrations and ammonia data from emission inventory indicates a contribution from this source of about 10\% of PM2.5 mass, thus resulting the single productive activity with the highest impact on PM2.5 at the investigated sites. Back trajectory analysis points out the relevant extra-regional contributions of two factors; indeed, oil combustion/ship emission is related to long-range transport of air masses overpassing the Mediterranean sea and secondary sulfate from Eastern Europe countries occasionally impacts on the Po Valley.},

  abstract = {Background: Spatially resolved exposure models are increasingly used in epidemiology. We previously reported that, although exhibiting a moderate correlation, pregnancy nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels estimated by the nearest air quality monitoring station (AQMS) model and a geostatistical model, showed similar associations with infant birth weight. Objectives: We extended this study by comparing a total of four exposure models, including two highly spatially resolved models: a land-use regression (LUR) model and a dispersion model. Comparisons were made in terms of predicted NO2 and particle (aerodynamic diameter b 10 μm, PM10) exposure and adjusted association with birth weight. Methods: The four exposure models were implemented in two French metropolitan areas where 1026 pregnant women were followed as part of the EDEN mother–child cohort. Results: Correlations between model predictions were high (≥0.70), except for NO2 between the AQMS and both the LUR (r = 0.54) and dispersion models (r = 0.63). Spatial variations as estimated by the AQMS model were greater for NO2 (95\%) than for PM10 (22\%). The direction of effect estimates of NO2 on birth weight varied according to the exposure model, while PM10 effect estimates were more consistent across exposure models. Conclusions: For PM10, highly spatially resolved exposure model agreed with the poor spatial resolution AQMS model in terms of estimated pollutant levels and health effects. For more spatially heterogeneous pollutants like NO2, although predicted levels from spatially resolved models (all but AQMS) agreed with each other, our results suggest that some may disagree with each other as well as with the AQMS regarding the direction of the estimated health effects.},

In this study, chemical and physical attributes, as well as the oxidative potential of fine particles produced from rice straw and pine stem burning in a laboratory-scale chamber were determined. The burning of rice straw generated notably lower emissions of fine particles and elemental carbon (EC) than did the burning of pine stems. The longer retention of ultrafine particles was observed for rice straw burning likely caused by this material’s longer period of initial flaming combustion. Organic carbon (OC), OC/EC, Kþ/OC, Kþ/EC, Zn, and alkanoic acid were higher in the fine particles of rice straw burning, while EC, Kþ/Cl, Fe, Cr, Al, Cu, and levoglucosan were higher for pine stem burning particles. Chemical data were consistent with a higher hygroscopic growth factor and cloud formation potential and lower amount of agglomerated soot for rice straw burning particles. Rice straw burning particles displayed an oxidative potential seven times higher than that of pine stems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Seasonal variations of the intrinsic (mass-normalized) oxidative potential (OPmDTT) and the extrinsic (air volume-normalized) oxidative potential (OPvDTT), as well as of targeted chemical components were investigated. Furthermore, a series of statistical analyses, including correlation, and multi linear regression (MLR) were performed to identify the most significant species contributing to the measured OPDTT. Although explaining a relatively small percentage of the OP variability (R2 = 0.389), the MLR model indicated HULIS as the major OPmDTT carrier contributing 58\% on average. Two receptor modelling approaches were further employed for the source apportionment of OPvDTT (a) direct Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF), and (b) a combination of PMF of PM2.5 mass concentrations followed by Multiple Linear Regression (PMF - MLR). Both approaches yielded meaningful, although somewhat different, results with direct PMF indicating vehicular emissions as the major contributor (76.3 ± 58.3\%) of OPvDTT followed by industrial emissions (16.9 ± 17.7\%), and biomass burning (7.3 ± 8.6\%), whereas according to the PMF-MLR approach, the main contributors to OPvDTT were biomass burning (40.7 ± 26.3\%), industrial emissions (24.3 ± 22.5\%), vehicular emissions (20.5 ± 15.2\%), and secondary aerosol (14.5 ± 15.0\%). The study provides new and additional insights on the oxidative activity of ambient PM highlighting the importance of identifying its linkage with chemical constituents and emission sources for developing air quality control strategies aiming to protect human health.},

OP denotes the ability of PM to deplete antioxidants and to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the lung. OP can be quantified using a variety of chemical assays and analytical techniques. Despite the widespread use of various OP metrics, there is no consensus or comprehensive inter-laboratory assessment on how these assays compare. In this work for the first time, we compared 11 OP indicators from acellular assays using standard reference material of urban PM. The OP indicators included ascorbic acid, glutathione, glutathione disulfide, cysteine, cystine, dithiothreitol, H2O2, •OH, O2•-, and empirical and theoretical redox potential of simulated lung lining fluid (SLF). The indicators showed first-order kinetics at low PM concentration (25 μg mL−1), whereas the kinetics were non-linear at higher PM concentrations. The indicators demonstrated mainly linear dose-response relationships at PM concentrations 25–100 μg mL−1, following similar trends with water-soluble transition metals, but they were not always proportional to PM concentrations, and demonstrated substantial differences in their sensitivities to PM. The results indicate the importance of using reduced reaction time for reliable OP quantification due to non-linearity in assay responses at high PM concentrations. This work shows that the choice of molecular probes and measurement techniques must be carefully considered when planning studies on OP of ambient air and should importantly include the association of OP metrics with health outcomes.},

In this study, two complementary OP assays were deployed, including dithiothreitol (DTT) and ascorbic acid (AA) assays, to investigate the potential toxicity (as generators of oxidative stress) of respirable fractions (DD4, {$<$} 4 μm) of deposited dust (DD500, {$<$} 500 μm) in underground low-S and low-pyrite coal mines in Henan Province, Central China. The OPDTT of DD4 is higher than that reported for other types of atmospheric PM, whereas the OPAA of DD4 is similar and/or slightly higher. Cross-correlation and multilinear regression analyses are applied using datasets of major mineral and geochemical patterns in the DD4 samples and the respective OP values to identify the major drivers for OP in respirable coal dust. Thereafter, the patterns of DD4 are compared with those of DD500 and the parent coals to determine the sources of OP-relevant substances. OPDTT is mainly governed by some trace elements (Sb, As, Li, B, Sr, and Pb) and minor minerals (anatase, quartz, siderite), and their synergistic effect may be one of the reasons for the high DTT consumption. For OPAA, quartz, total clay (sum of illite, kaolinite, tobelite, and clinochlore) and Ni, Cr, Co, Si, and S, play an important role in regulating the OPAA of pyrite-free DD4 samples. These OP-relevant substances have three sources: coal dust, which has a similar composition in DD4, DD500, and the parent coal (such as siderite and its associated elements); gangue dust, which does not occur in the parent coal but is widely detected in DD4 and DD500 (such as quartz, kaolinite, and relevant elements); and cement dust (from gunite galleries), which is mainly calcite- and calcite-associated elements.},

The concentration of PM10 and its chemical components including organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), water soluble inorganic ionic components (WSIC) and major and trace elements showed strong seasonal cycle with maxima during winter (PM10: 241.4 ± 50.5 lg m3; OC: 34.7 ± 10.2 lg m3; EC: 10.9 ± 3.0 lg m3) and minima during monsoon (PM10: 140.1 ± 43.9 lg m3; OC: 15.5 ± 7.5 lg m3; EC: 4.9 ± 2.3 lg m3). In this process, chemical composition of the PM10 mass was reconstructed using IMPROVE equation from the observed elemental composition. The highest contribution comes from particulate organic matter (24\%) to the estimated average values of PM10 apart from other components e.g., soil/crustal matter (16\%), ammonium sulphate (7\%), ammonium nitrate (6\%), aged sea salt (5\%) and light absorbing carbon (4\%). Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) analysis quantified the sector wise contribution from the secondary aerosols (21.7\%), soil dust (20.7\%), fossil fuel combustion (17.4\%), vehicle emissions (16.8\%), and biomass burning (13.4\%) to PM10 mass at the observational site of Delhi.},

The annual average mass concentration of PM2.5 was 122 ± 94.1 lg m-3. Strong seasonal variation was observed in PM2.5 mass concentration and its chemical composition with maxima during winter and minima during monsoon. A receptor model, positive matrix factorization (PMF) was applied for source apportionment of PM2.5 mass concentration. The PMF model resolved the major sources of PM2.5 as secondary aerosols (21.3 \%), followed by soil dust (20.5 \%), vehicle emissions (19.7 \%), biomass burning (14.3 \%), fossil fuel combustion (13.7 \%), industrial emissions (6.2 \%) and sea salt (4.3 \%).},

  abstract = {Biodiesel and the use of an emissions control system significantly reduced the oxidative potential of diesel exhaust particles, which correlated with reduction in emissions of elemental carbon.           ,                             Exposure to diesel exhaust particles (DEP) has been linked to adverse human health outcomes. DEPs are reactive and can directly or indirectly lead to oxidative stress, which promotes inflammation in the body. The oxidative potential (OP) of DEPs is not well understood, particularly for combustion with alternative fuels, under different engine loads, and in combination with modern emissions control devices. In this study, we measured the OP of DEPs using a dithiothreitol assay (OP-DTT) from a modern-day non-road diesel engine for two different fuels (conventional diesel and soy-based biodiesel), two different engine loads (idle and 50\% load), and with and without an emissions control system. The OP-DTT of DEPs was sensitive to the fuel used and the presence of an emissions control system but not to the engine load. On average, the use of biodiesel resulted in factor of ∼6 reduction in OP-DTT normalized to the DEP mass and a factor of ∼12 reduction in OP-DTT normalized to the fuel consumed. The use of the emissions control, on average, resulted in a factor of ∼6 reduction in OP-DTT normalized to the DEP mass and a three order of magnitude decrease in OP-DTT normalized to the fuel consumed. When studied in conjunction with the DEP composition, the OP-DTT seemed to correlate most strongly with elemental carbon (EC), followed by semi-volatile organic vapors. Assays performed on DEPs where EC was deliberately filtered out suggested that the species responsible for the OP-DTT might be correlated with EC but would need to be water soluble (               e.g.               , quinones). The semi-volatile organic vapors accounted for more than a quarter of the OP-DTT of DEPs collected on the quartz filters. Finally, sensitivity studies performed with a different filter membrane (               i.e.               , Teflon®) and solvent (               i.e.               , dichloromethane) tended to increase the OP-DTT value. OP-DTT is emerging as an important metric for studying the adverse effects of DEPs and PM               2.5               on human health; results of this work help define the sources and components of diesel PM               2.5               that contribute to OP-DTT.},

Here, we investigate how OP depends on sources and chemical composition and how OP varies by land use type and neighborhood socioeconomic position in the Los Angeles area. We measured OH formation (OPOH), dithiothreitol loss (OPDTT), black carbon, and 52 metals and elements for 54 total PM2.5 samples collected in September 2019 and February 2020. The Positive Matrix Factorization source apportionment model identified four sources contributing to volume-normalized OPOH: vehicular exhaust, brake and tire wear, soil and road dust, and mixed secondary and marine. Exhaust emissions contributed 42\% of OPOH, followed by 21\% from brake and tire wear. Similar results were observed for the OPDTT source apportionment. Furthermore, by linking measured PM2.5 and OP with census tract level socioeconomic and health outcome data provided by CalEnviroScreen, we found that the most disadvantaged neighborhoods were exposed to both the most toxic particles and the highest particle concentrations. OPOH exhibited the largest inverse social gradients, followed by OPDTT and PM2.5 mass. Finally, OPOH was the metric most strongly correlated with adverse health outcome indicators.},

  abstract = {Poor air quality is globally the largest environmental health risk. Epidemiological studies have uncovered clear relationships of gaseous pollutants and particulate matter (PM) with adverse health outcomes, including mortality by cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Studies of health impacts by aerosols are highly multidisciplinary with a broad range of scales in space and time. We assess recent advances and future challenges regarding aerosol effects on health from molecular to global scales through epidemiological studies, field measurements, health-related properties of PM, and multiphase interactions of oxidants and PM upon respiratory deposition. Global modeling combined with epidemiological exposureresponse functions indicates that ambient air pollution causes more than four million premature deaths per year. Epidemiological studies usually refer to PM mass concentrations, but some health effects may relate to specific constituents such as bioaerosols, polycyclic aromatic compounds, and transition metals. Various analytical techniques and cellular and molecular assays are applied to assess the redox activity of PM and the formation of reactive oxygen species. Multiphase chemical interactions of lung antioxidants with atmospheric pollutants are crucial to the mechanistic and molecular understanding of oxidative stress upon respiratory deposition. The role of distinct PM components in health impacts and mortality needs to be clarified by integrated research on various spatiotemporal scales for better evaluation and mitigation of aerosol effects on public health in the Anthropocene.},

  abstract = {This paper presents results from positive matrix factorization (PMF) of organic molecular marker data to investigate the sources of organic carbon (OC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. PMF analysis of 21 different combinations of input species found essentially the same seven factors with distinctive source-class-specific groupings of molecular markers. To link factors with source classes we directly compare PMF factor profiles with actual source profiles. Six of the PMF factors appear related to primary emissions from sources such as motor vehicles, biomass combustion, and food cooking. Each primary factor contributed between 5\% and 10\% of the annual-average OC with the exception of the cooking related factor which contributed 20\% of the OC. However, the contribution of the cooking factor was sensitive to the specific combinations of input species. PMF could not differentiate between gasoline and diesel emissions, but the aggregate contribution of primary emissions from these two source classes is estimated to be less than 10\% of the annual-average OC. One factor appears related to secondary organic aerosol based on its substantial contribution to biogenic oxidation products. This secondary factor contributed more than 50\% of the summertime average OC. Reasonable agreement was observed between the PMF results and those of a previously published chemical mass balance (CMB) analysis of the same molecular marker dataset. Individual PMF factors are correlated with specific CMB sources, but systematic biases exist between the two estimates. These biases were generally within the uncertainty of the two estimates, but there is also evidence that PMF is not cleanly differentiating between source classes.},

  abstract = {Gaseous and particulate organic compounds are key components of atmospheric chemistry and better understanding their composition, sources and processes is essential to limit their impacts. Source apportionment using positive matrix factorization (PMF) is customarily performed for such studies. Combining organic aerosol data with their gaseous precursors was shown to be a promising approach, however very rarely attempted so far, to refine their origins using PMF. In this study, colocated continuous proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) and aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM) measurements were performed at the suburban SIRTA station located in the Paris region. A combined dataset using both instruments during summer (June–August 2020) was then used in an exploratory PMF analysis to investigate the sources and processes of organic compounds, particularly the influences of biogenic emissions and important photochemical reactions on the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in this period of the year. Specific parameters and evaluation procedures were needed to ensure an equivalent representation of both instruments in the PMF model. A weighing factor was applied to the PTR-MS uncertainties which was controlled and optimized based on the analysis of the modelled scaled residuals. Seven main factors were obtained, describing anthropogenic sources (hydrocarbon-like organics, cooking-like organics), primary biogenic volatile organics, nighttime VOC, oxidized organics, aged organics and a specific isoprene oxidation factor which contributed 11 \% to VOC and 4 \% to OA. Compared to single-instrument PMFs, more factors were obtained, notably including the cooking-like factor which is not usually resolved using only ACSM data. This method also showed a better mathematical performance for the PTR-MS variables (mean absolute scaled residuals lower for the combined PMF (11.2) than for the PTR-MS-only PMF (38.2)) and a better separation of the factors for the ACSM variables in the combined PMF.},

  abstract = {Biomass combustion is an important primary source of particles with adsorbed biomarker compounds in the global atmosphere. The introduction of natural product organic compounds into smoke occurs primarily by direct volatilization/steam stripping and by thermal alteration based on combustion temperature. Although the molecular compositions of organic matter in smoke particles are highly variable, the molecular tracers are generally still source specific. Dehydroabietic acid is typically the major tracer for conifer smoke in the atmosphere. Degradation products from biopolymers (e.g. levoglucosan from cellulose, methoxyphenols from lignin) are also excellent tracers. Additional markers of thermally-altered and directly-emitted natural products in smoke have been defined which aids the assessment of the organic matter types and input from biomass combustion to aerosols. The precursor to product approach of compound characterization by organic geochemistry has also been applied successfully to provide source specific tracers for studying the chemistry and dispersion of ambient aerosols and the intermingling of natural with anthropogenic emissions and with smoke plumes. A brief review of the organic matter composition in aerosols derived from the major sources is also given, with emphasis on the detection of biomass burning components. These major sources are the natural background from biogenic detritus (e.g. plant wax, microbes, etc.) and anthropogenic particle emissions (e.g. oils, soot, synthetics, compounds, etc.). The emissions of organic constituents in coal smoke particulate matter are also reviewed and depend on combustion temperature, ventilation, burn time, and coal rank (geologic maturity). The components of peat and brown coal and to a lesser degree semi-bituminous coal consist mainly of hydrocarbons, biomarkers, and aromatic components, quite similar to burning of contemporary biomass. Dispersion from the source and long range transport of smoke particulate matter with the associated organic compounds is also discussed. \# 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Some studies have suggested that particulate matter (PM) levels during pregnancy may be associated with birth weight. Road traffic is a major source of fine PM (PM with aerodynamic diameter {$<$} 2.5 µm; PM2.5). OBJECTIVE: We determined to characterize the influence of maternal exposure to atmospheric pollutants due to road traffic and urban activities on offspring term birth weight. METHODS: Women from a birth cohort [the LISA (Influences of Lifestyle Related Factors on the Human Immune System and Development of Allergies in Children) cohort] who delivered a nonpremature baby with a birth weight {$>$} 2,500 g in Munich metropolitan area were included. We assessed PM2.5, PM2.5 absorbance (which depends on the blackness of PM2.5, a marker of trafficrelated air pollution), and nitrogen dioxide levels using a land-use regression model, taking into account the type and length of roads, population density, land coverage around the home address, and temporal variations in pollution during pregnancy. Using Poisson regression, we estimated prevalence ratios (PR) of birth weight {$<$} 3,000 g, adjusted for gestational duration, sex, maternal smoking, height, weight, and education. RESULTS: Exposure was defined for 1,016 births. Taking the lowest quartile of exposure during pregnancy as a reference, the PR of birth weight {$<$} 3,000 g associated with the highest quartile was 1.7 for PM2.5 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.2–2.7], 1.8 for PM2.5 absorbance (95\% CI, 1.1–2.7), and 1.2 for NO2 (95\% CI, 0.7–1.7). The PR associated with an increase of 1 µg/m3 in PM2.5 levels was 1.13 (95\% CI, 1.00–1.29). CONCLUSION: Increases in PM2.5 levels and PM2.5 absorbance were associated with decreases in term birth weight. Traffic-related air pollutants may have adverse effects on birth weight.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies relying on outdoor pollutants measures have reported associations between air pollutants and birth weight. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to assess the relation between maternal personal exposure to airborne benzene during pregnancy and fetal growth. METHODS: We recruited pregnant women in two French maternity hospitals in 2005–2006 as part of the EDEN mother–child cohort. A subsample of 271 nonsmoking women carried a diffusive air sampler for a week during the 27th gestational week, allowing assessment of benzene exposure. We estimated head circumference of the offspring by ultrasound measurements during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and at birth. RESULTS: Median benzene exposure was 1.8 µg/m3 (5th, 95th percentiles, 0.5, 7.5 µg/m3). Logtransformed benzene exposure was associated with a gestational age–adjusted decrease of 68 g in mean birth weight [95\% confidence interval (CI), –135 to –1 g] and of 1.9 mm in mean head circumference at birth (95\% CI, –3.8 to 0.0 mm). It was associated with an adjusted decrease of 1.9 mm in head circumference assessed during the third trimester (95\% CI, –4.0 to 0.3 mm) and of 1.5 mm in head circumference assessed at the end of the second trimester of pregnancy (95\% CI, –3.1 to 0 mm). CONCLUSIONS: Our prospective study among pregnant women is one of the first to rely on personal monitoring of exposure; a limitation is that exposure was assessed during 1 week only. Maternal benzene exposure was associated with decreases in birth weight and head circumference during pregnancy and at birth. This association could be attributable to benzene and a mixture of associated traffic-related air pollutants.},

Sampling was performed in downtown Toronto ∼15 m from a major road. The mass spectra from the AMS and PTR-MS were combined into a unified dataset, which was analysed using positive matrix factorization (PMF). The two instruments were given balanced weight in the PMF analysis by the application of a scaling factor to the uncertainties of each instrument. A residual based metric, 1esc, was used to evaluate the instrument relative weight within each solution. The PMF analysis yielded a 6-factor solution that included factors characteristic of regional transport, local traffic emissions, charbroiling and oxidative processing. The unified dataset provides information on emission sources (particle and VOC) and atmospheric processing that cannot be obtained from the datasets of the individual instruments: (1) apportionment of oxygenated VOCs to either direct emission sources or secondary reaction products; (2) improved correlation of oxygenated aerosol factors with photochemical age; and (3) increased detail regarding the composition of oxygenated organic aerosol factors. This analysis represents the first application of PMF to a unified AMS/PTR-MS dataset.},

  abstract = {Rotational ambiguity in factor analyses leads to solutions that are not always consistent with reality. The inherent non-negativity constraints in positive matrix factorization (PMF) help to prevent factor solutions from becoming overly unrealistic, but they are not sufficient to prevent unwanted rotations that could manifest in factors that should have similar compositions varying across multiple sites. The Canadian National Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS) network operates five fine particulate matter (PM2.5) speciation sites in Ontario. Data from these sites from 2005 to 2010 were subjected to PMF to obtain factors representing sources of particulate matter. Eight factors were found to be common across these sites. These factors had profiles that varied greatly from one site to the other, suggesting that the PMF solutions were impacted by some rotational ambiguity. New features in the EPA PMF V5 program allow the use of a priori information to impose mathematical constraints that guide the evolution of the factor solutions. These constraints reduce the rotational space. In situations where major emissions sources are known and located in the neighborhood of receptors, or emissions inventories and literature source profiles exist, it is easy to use these profiles to force the factor solutions to conform to the expected signatures. In our case, reported source profiles were neither available nor applicable due to the large spatial span of potential sources and receptor sites. This work describes how such constraints can be generated and used in these complex situations. The fundamental principle explored in this work is the concept of 'stiffness' of PMF solutions to identify the desirable non-rotating factors.},

  abstract = {The Canadian National Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS) network operates five fine particulate matter (PM2.5) speciation sites in Ontario. Data from 2005 to 2010 from these sites were subjected to constrained positive matrix factorization (PMF) to obtain factors of particulate matter pollution. Eight factors were found to be common across the sites. These constrained factors were particulate sulfate and nitrate, aged combustion aerosols, biomass/wood combustion, non-ferrous metal smelting, crustal matter, steel works, and road salt. Other factors found at these sites were largely related to local sources in their respective neighbourhoods. Diagnostic results from constraining the PMF factors could be used to select the appropriate post-PMF analyses as they reveal the factors that were expected to have regional or local sources. Interpretation of the spatial trends of factors was guided by the extent of similarity of target ratios across the five sites as determined by their coefficient of variation (C.V.). On average, particulate sulfate had PM2.5 mass contributions that ranged from 7\% (Wallaceburg) to 36\% (Simcoe) and nitrate species ranged from 7\% (Simcoe) to 23\% (Windsor). A clear low rural - high urban divide for particulate nitrate was also observed. These non-uniform impacts across the sites indicate that a single representative location is not suitable for studying PM2.5 in Ontario. Temporal variations showed greater abundance of particulate sulfate in the summer and particulate nitrate in the winter respectively. Yearly median values of the sulfate factor that is largely energy-related have been declining for most sites since peaking in 2007. A trajectory ensemble model, simplified quantitative transport bias analysis (sQTBA) was used to identify potential source regions of the constrained sulfate and nitrate factors while radial plots of the conditional probability function (CPF) were used to explore the more locally-sourced factors. The US Midwest, east coast and Canada's west were dominant regional sources.},

  abstract = {Particulate matters (PMs) and their associated chemical compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are important factors to evaluate air pollution and its health impacts particularly in developing countries. Source identification of these compounds can be used for air quality management. The aim of this study was to identify the sources of PM2.5-bound PAHs in Isfahan city, a metropolitan and industrialized area in central Iran. The PM2.5 samples were collected at 50 sites during 1 year. Source identification and apportionment of particle-bound PAHs were carried out using diagnostic ratios (DRs) of PAHs and positive matrix factorization (PMF) model. The results showed that the concentrations of PM2.5 ranged from 8 to 291 μg/m3 with an average of 60.2 ± 53.9 μg/m3, whereas the sum of concentrations of the 19 PAH compounds (ƩPAHs) ranged from 0.3 to 61.4 ng/m3 with an average of 4.65 ± 8.54 ng/m3. The PAH compounds showed their highest and lowest concentrations occurred in cold and warm seasons, respectively. The mean concentration of benzo[a]pyrene (1.357 ng m−3) in December–January, when inversion occured, was higher than the Iranian national standard value showing the risk of exposure to PM2.5-bound PAHs. Applying DRs suggested that the sources of the PAHs were mainly from fuel combustion. The main sources identified by the PMF model were gasoline combustion (23.8 to 33.1\%) followed by diesel combustion (20.6 to 24.8\%), natural gas combustion (9.5 to 28.4\%), evaporative-uncombusted (9.5 to 23.0\%), industrial activities (8.4 to 13.5\%), and unknown sources (2.8 to 15.7\%). It is concluded that transportation, industrial activities, and combustion of natural gas (both in residential-commercial and industrial sectors) as the main sources of PAHs in PM2.5 should be managed in the metropolitan area, particularly in cold seasons.},

However, one to six overflows per year still occur. Chemical mass balance (CMB) and positive matrix factorization (PMF) modeling was done in order to find origins of flows and pollutants in CSOs. Based on overflow events from 2000 to 2006 (CMB) and 2004 to 2006 (PMF), we found that between 27\% and 56\% of the total overflow is from sanitary sewage and most of the remaining from stormwater with possible minor contribution (p8\%) from groundwater. Most total suspended solids and metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Ni, Hg, and Zn) are from stormwater, while sanitary sewage carries large contributions (X28\%) of BOD5, NH3, and total phosphorus. The fraction of NH3 is especially high, i.e., X58\%. Implications for a possible future sewer separation in combined sewer areas into separate sanitary and storm sewers are discussed.},

  abstract = {Urban air pollution is a matter of concern due to its health hazards and the continuous population growth exposed to it at different urban areas worldwide. Nowadays, more than 55\% of the world population live in urban areas. One of the main challenges to guide pollution control policies is related to pollutant source assessment. In this line, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Positive Matrix Factorization (EPA-PMF) has been extensively employed worldwide as a reference model for quantification of source contributions. However, EPA-PMF presents issues associated to source identification and discrimination due to the collinearities among the source tracers. Multi-Isotopic Fingerprints (MIF) have demonstrated good resolution for source discrimination, since urban sources are characterized by specific isotopic signatures. Source quantification based on total aerosol mass is the main limitation of MIF. This study reports strategies for PMF and MIF combination to improve source identification/discrimination and its quantification in urban areas. We have three main findings: (1) cross-validation of PMF source identification based on Pb and Zn isotopic fingerprints, (2) source apportionment in the MIF model for total PM mass, and (3) new insights into potential Zn isotopic signatures of biomass burning and secondary aerosol. We support future studies on the improvement of isotopic fingerprints database of sources based on diverse elements or compounds to boost advances of MIF model applications in atmospheric sciences.},

  abstract = {Abstract. In this study, the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) receptor model (version 5.0) was used to identify and quantify major sources contributing to particulate matter (PM) number concentrations, using PM number size distributions in the range of 13 nm to 10 μm combined with several auxiliary variables, including black carbon (BC), elemental and organic carbon (EC/OC), PM mass concentrations, gaseous pollutants, meteorological, and traffic counts data, collected for about 9 months between August 2014 and 2015 in central Los Angeles, CA. Several parameters, including particle number and volume size distribution profiles, profiles of auxiliary variables, contributions of different factors in different seasons to the total number concentrations, diurnal variations of each of the resolved factors in the cold and warm phases, weekday/weekend analysis for each of the resolved factors, and correlation between auxiliary variables and the relative contribution of each of the resolved factors, were used to identify PM sources. A six-factor solution was identified as the optimum for the aforementioned input data. The resolved factors comprised nucleation, traffic 1, traffic 2 (having a larger mode diameter than traffic 1 factor), urban background aerosol, secondary aerosol, and soil/road dust. Traffic sources (1 and 2) were the major contributor to PM number concentrations, collectively making up to above 60 \% (60.8–68.4 \%) of the total number concentrations during the study period. Their contribution was also significantly higher in the cold phase compared to the warm phase. Nucleation was another major factor significantly contributing to the total number concentrations (an overall contribution of 17 \%, ranging from 11.7 \% to 24 \%), having a larger contribution during the warm phase than in the cold phase. The other identified factors were urban background aerosol, secondary aerosol, and soil/road dust, with relative contributions of approximately 12 \% (7.4–17.1), 2.1 \% (1.5–2.5 \%), and 1.1 \% (0.2–6.3 \%), respectively, overall accounting for about 15 \% (15.2–19.8 \%) of PM number concentrations. As expected, PM number concentrations were dominated by factors with smaller mode diameters, such as traffic and nucleation. On the other hand, PM volume and mass concentrations in the study area were mostly affected by sources having larger mode diameters, including secondary aerosols and soil/road dust. Results from the present study can be used as input parameters in future epidemiological studies to link PM sources to adverse health effects as well as by policy makers to set targeted and more protective emission standards for PM.},

  abstract = {PM10 source apportionment was performed by positive matrix factorization (PMF) using specific primary and secondary organic molecular markers on samples collected over a one year period (2013) at an urban station in Grenoble (France). The results provided a 9-factor optimum solution, including sources rarely apportioned in the literature, such as two types of primary biogenic organic aerosols (fungal spores and plant debris), as well as specific biogenic and anthropogenic secondary organic aerosols (SOA). These sources were identified thanks to the use of key organic markers, namely, polyols, odd number higher alkanes, and several SOA markers related to the oxidation of isoprene, α-pinene, toluene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Primary and secondary biogenic contributions together accounted for at least 68\% of the total organic carbon (OC) in the summer, while anthropogenic primary and secondary sources represented at least 71\% of OC during wintertime. A very significant contribution of anthropogenic SOA was estimated in the winter during an intense PM pollution event (PM10 {$>$} 50 μg m− 3 for several days; 18\% of PM10 and 42\% of OC). Specific meteorological conditions with a stagnation of pollutants over 10 days and possibly Fenton-like chemistry and self-amplification cycle of SOA formation could explain such high anthropogenic SOA concentrations during this period. Finally, PMF outputs were also used to investigate the origins of humic-like substances (HuLiS), which represented 16\% of OC on an annual average basis. The results indicated that HuLiS were mainly associated with biomass burning (22\%), secondary inorganic (22\%), mineral dust (15\%) and biogenic SOA (14\%) factors. This study is probably the first to state that HuLiS are significantly associated with mineral dust.},

  abstract = {21 The present study proposes an advanced methodology to refine the source apportionment of 22 organic aerosol (OA). This methodology is based on the combination of offline and online 23 datasets in a single Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) analysis using the multilinear engine 24 (ME-2) algorithm and a customized time synchronization procedure. It has been applied to data 25 from measurements conducted in the Paris region (France) during a PM pollution event in March 26 2015. Measurements included OA ACSM (Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor) mass spectra 27 and specific primary and secondary organic molecular markers from PM10 filters on their original 28 time resolution (30 min for ACSM and 4 h for PM10 filters). Comparison with the conventional 29 PMF analysis of the ACSM OA dataset (PMF-ACSM) showed very good agreement for the 30 discrimination between primary and secondary OA fractions with about 75\% of the OA mass of 31 secondary origin. Furthermore, the use of the combined datasets allowed the deconvolution of 3 32 primary OA (POA) factors and 7 secondary OA (SOA) factors. A clear identification of the 33 source/origin of 54\% of the total SOA mass could be achieved thanks to specific molecular 34 markers. Specifically, 28\% of that fraction was linked to combustion sources (biomass burning 35 and traffic emissions). A clear identification of primary traffic OA was also obtained using the 36 PMF-combined analysis while PMF-ACSM only gave a proxy for this OA source in the form of 37 total hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA) mass concentrations. In addition, the primary biomass 38 burning-related OA source was explained by two OA factors, BBOA and OPOA-like BBOA. 39 This new approach has showed undeniable advantages over the conventional approaches by 40 providing valuable insights into the processes involved in SOA formation and their sources. 41 However, the origins of highly oxidized SOA could not be fully identified due to the lack of 42 specific molecular markers for such aged SOA. 43 3},

  abstract = {Abstract. This study presents the source apportionment of PM2.5 performed by positive matrix factorization (PMF) on data presented here which were collected at urban (Institute of Atmospheric Physics – IAP) and rural (Pinggu – PG) sites in Beijing as part of the Atmospheric Pollution and Human Health in a Chinese megacity (APHH-Beijing) field campaigns. The campaigns were carried out from 9~November to 11~December 2016 and from 22~May to 24~June 2017. The PMF analysis included both organic and inorganic species, and a seven-factor output provided the most reasonable solution for the PM2.5 source apportionment. These factors are interpreted as traffic emissions, biomass burning, road dust, soil dust, coal combustion, oil combustion, and secondary inorganics. Major contributors to PM2.5 mass were secondary inorganics (IAP: 22\,\%; PG: 24\,\%), biomass burning (IAP: 36\,\%; PG: 30\,\%), and coal combustion (IAP: 20\,\%; PG: 21\,\%) sources during the winter period at both sites. Secondary inorganics (48\,\%), road dust (20\,\%), and coal combustion (17\,\%) showed the highest contribution during summer at PG, while PM2.5 particles were mainly composed of soil dust (35\,\%) and secondary inorganics (40\,\%) at IAP. Despite this, factors that were resolved based on metal signatures were not fully resolved and indicate a mixing of two or more sources. PMF results were also compared with sources resolved from another receptor model (i.e. chemical mass balance – CMB) and PMF performed on other measurements (i.e. online and offline aerosol mass spectrometry, AMS) and showed good agreement for some but not all sources. The biomass burning factor in PMF may contain aged aerosols as a good correlation was observed between biomass burning and oxygenated fractions (r2=\,0.6–0.7) from AMS. The PMF failed to resolve some sources identified by the CMB and AMS and appears to overestimate the dust sources. A comparison with earlier PMF source apportionment studies from the Beijing area highlights the very divergent findings from application of this method.},

Concurrent measurements included a particleinto-liquid sampler (PILS-IC), a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS), an AE-33 Aethalometer, and ion chromatography analysis on 24 or 12 h filter samples. The aim of the study was to characterize the seasonal variability of the main submicron aerosol constituents and decipher the sources of organic aerosol (OA). Organics were found to contribute almost half of the submicron mass, with 30 min resolution concentrations during wintertime reaching up to 200 µg m−3. During winter (all three campaigns combined), primary sources contributed about 33 \% of the organic fraction, and comprised biomass burning (10 \%), fossil fuel combustion (13 \%), and cooking (10 \%), while the remaining 67 \% was attributed to secondary aerosol. The semi-volatile component of the oxidized organic aerosol (SV-OOA; 22 \%) was found to be clearly linked to combustion sources, in particular biomass burning; part of the very oxidized, low-volatility component (LV-OOA; 44 \%) could also be attributed to the oxidation of emissions from these primary combustion sources.},

  abstract = {Background: Ambient particulate matter (PM) exposure is associated with respiratory and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. To what extent such effects are different for PM obtained from different sources or locations is still unclear. This study investigated the in vitro toxicity of ambient PM collected at different sites in the Netherlands in relation to PM composition and oxidative potential. Method: PM was sampled at eight sites: three traffic sites, an underground train station, as well as a harbor, farm, steelworks, and urban background location. Coarse (2.5-10 μm), fine ({$<$} 2.5 μm) and quasi ultrafine PM (qUF; {$<$} 0.18 μm) were sampled at each site. Murine macrophages (RAW 264.7 cells) were exposed to increasing concentrations of PM from these sites (6.25-12.5-25-50-100 μg/ml; corresponding to 3.68-58.8 μg/cm2). Following overnight incubation, MTT-reduction activity (a measure of metabolic activity) and the release of pro-inflammatory markers (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, TNF-a; Interleukin-6, IL-6; Macrophage Inflammatory Protein-2, MIP-2) were measured. The oxidative potential and the endotoxin content of each PM sample were determined in a DTT- and LAL-assay respectively. Multiple linear regression was used to assess the relationship between the cellular responses and PM characteristics: concentration, site, size fraction, oxidative potential and endotoxin content. Results: Most PM samples induced a concentration-dependent decrease in MTT-reduction activity and an increase in pro-inflammatory markers with the exception of the urban background and stop \& go traffic samples. Fine and qUF samples of traffic locations, characterized by a high concentration of elemental and organic carbon, induced the highest pro-inflammatory activity. The pro-inflammatory response to coarse samples was associated with the endotoxin level, which was found to increase dramatically during a three-day sample concentration procedure in the laboratory. The underground samples, characterized by a high content of transition metals, showed the largest decrease in MTT-reduction activity. PM size fraction was not related to MTT-reduction activity, whereas there was a statistically significant difference in pro-inflammatory activity between Fine and qUF PM. Furthermore, there was a statistically significant negative association between PM oxidative potential and MTT-reduction activity. Conclusion: The response of RAW264.7 cells to ambient PM was markedly different using samples collected at various sites in the Netherlands that differed in their local PM emission sources. Our results are in support of other investigations showing that the chemical composition as well as oxidative potential are determinants of PM induced toxicity in vitro.},

It has been established so far that the detrimental health effects of particles cannot be explained by a single param-eter, such as particle mass, as the complexity of chemical composition and reac-tivity of particles are not always represented by the mass loadings. The oxidative potential (OP) of aerosol particles represents a promising indicator of their po-tential toxicity. To develop strategies and regulations at improving the air quali-ty, an increasing number of studies are focused on the application of source ap-portionment (SA) of PM., while a limited number of SA investigations have been applied to OP. In this review previous research of SA of atmospheric PM OP and proposed guidelines for future studies are summarized. Most of the research studies were carried out in an urban area and focused on PM2.5, while few studies examined other PM fractions. It was noted that the three dominant contributors to OP were biomass burning (9-97\%), secondary aerosols (6-67\%), and traf-fic/vehicles (16-88\%). The presence of other factors that contributed to the in-crease of OP to a lesser extent depended on the location and season. Further, a considerable discrepancy in the contribution of various OP vs. PM sources was discovered using SA models. Because of this, the use of SA is not equivalent when considering the mass of PM and its toxicity.},

Because, sampling species' distributions is costly, we explored sample size needs for accurate modeling for three predictive modeling methods via re-sampling of data for well-sampled species, and developed curves of model improvement with increasing sample size. In general, under a coarse surrogate model, and machine-learning methods, average success rate at predicting occurrence of a species at a location, or accuracy, was 90\% of maximum within ten sample points, and was near maximal at 50 data points. However, a fine surrogate model and logistic regression model had significantly lower rates of increase in accuracy with increasing sample size, reaching similar maximum accuracy at 100 data points. The choice of environmental variables also produced unpredictable effects on accuracy over the range of sample sizes on the logistic regression method, while the machine-learning method had robust performance throughout. Examining correlates of model performance across species, extent of geographic distribution was the only significant ecological factor. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Background: The evidence from observational epidemiological studies of a link between long-term air pollution exposure and diabetes prevalence and incidence is currently mixed. Some studies found the strongest associations of diabetes with fine particles, other studies with nitrogen dioxide and some studies found no associations. Objectives: Our aim was to investigate associations between long-term exposure to multiple air pollutants and diabetes prevalence in a large national survey in the Netherlands. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional analysis using the 2012 Dutch national health survey to investigate the associations between the 2009 annual average concentrations of multiple air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, PM10 − 2.5, PM2.5 absorbance, OPDTT, OPESR and NO2) and diabetes prevalence, among 289,703 adults. Air pollution exposure was assessed by land use regression models. Diabetes was defined based on a combined measure of self-reported physician diagnosis and medication prescription from an external database. Using logistic regression, we adjusted for potential confounders, including neighborhood- and individual socio-economic status and lifestyle-related risk factors such as smoking habits, alcohol consumption, physical activity and BMI. Results: After adjustment for potential confounders, all pollutants (except PM2.5) were associated with diabetes prevalence. In two-pollutant models, NO2 and OPDTT remained associated with increased diabetes prevalence. For NO2 and OPDTT, single-pollutant ORs per interquartile range were 1.07 (95\% CI: 1.05, 1.09) and 1.08 (95\% CI: 1.05, 1.10), respectively. Stratified analysis showed no consistent effect modification by any of the included known diabetes risk factors. Conclusions: Long-term residential air pollution exposure was associated with diabetes prevalence in a large health survey in the Netherlands, strengthening the evidence of air pollution being an important diabetes risk factor. Most consistent associations were observed for NO2 and oxidative potential of PM2.5 measured by the DTT assay. The finding of an association with the oxidative potential of fine particles but not with PM2.5, suggests that particle composition may be important for a potential effect on diabetes.},

High-dimensional problems are common not only in genetics, but also in some areas of psychological research, where only a few subjects can be measured because of time or cost constraints, yet a large amount of data is generated for each subject. Random forests have been shown to achieve a high prediction accuracy in such applications and to provide descriptive variable importance measures reflecting the impact of each variable in both main effects and interactions. The aim of this work is to introduce the principles of the standard recursive partitioning methods as well as recent methodological improvements, to illustrate their usage for low and high-dimensional data exploration, but also to point out limitations of the methods and potential pitfalls in their practical application. Application of the methods is illustrated with freely available implementations in the R system for statistical computing. © 2009 American Psychological Association.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Online instruments have been widely applied for the measurement of PM2.5 and its chemical components; however, these instruments have a major shortcoming in terms of the lack or limited number of species in field measurements. To this end, a new mass closure PM2.5 online integrated system was developed and applied in this work to develop more comprehensive information on chemical species in PM2.5. For the new system, one isokinetic sampling system for PM2.5 was coupled with an aerosol chemical speciation monitor (Aerodyne, ACSM), an aethalometer (Magee, AE-31), an automated multi-metals monitor (Cooper Corporation, Xact-625) and a hybrid synchronized ambient particulate real-time analyzer monitor (Thermo Scientific, SHARP-5030i) to enable high-resolution temporal (1\,h) measurements of organic matter, SO42-, NO3-, Cl−, NH4+, black carbon, important elements and PM2.5 mass concentrations. The new online integrated system was first deployed in Shenzhen, China, to measure the PM2.5 composition from 25~September to 30~October 2019. Our results showed that the average PM2.5 concentration in this work was 33\,µg\,m−3, and the measured species reconstructed the PM2.5 well and almost formed a mass closure (94\,\%). The multi-linear engine (ME-2) model was employed for the comprehensive online PM2.5 chemical dataset to apportion the sources with predetermined constraints, in which the organic ion fragment m/z~44 in ACSM data was used as the tracer for secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Nine sources were determined and obtained reasonable time series and diurnal variations in this study, including identified SOA (23\,\%), secondary sulfate (22\,\%), vehicle emissions (18\,\%), biomass burning (11\,\%), coal burning (8.0\,\%), secondary nitrate (5.3\,\%), fugitive dust (3.8\,\%), ship emissions (3.7\,\%) and industrial emissions (2.1\,\%). The potential source contribution function (PSCF) analysis indicated that the major source area could be the region north of the sampling site. This is the first system in the world that can perform online measurements of PM2.5 components with a mass closure, thus providing a new powerful tool for PM2.5 long-term daily measurement and source apportionment.},

  abstract = {An Aerodyne Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM) was first deployed in Beijing, China for characterization of summer organic and inorganic aerosols. The non-refractory submicron aerosol (NR-PM 1) species, i.e., organics, sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and chloride were measured in situ at a time resolution of 15 min from 26 June to 28 August, 2011. The total NR-PM 1 measured by the ACSM agrees well with the PM 2.5 measured by a Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance (TEOM). The average total NR-PM 1 mass for the entire study is 50 ± 30 μg m -3 with the organics being the major fraction, accounting for 40\% on average. High concentration and mass fraction of nitrate were frequently observed in summer in Beijing, likely due to the high humidity and excess gaseous ammonia that facilitate the transformation of HNO 3 to ammonium nitrate particles. Nitrate appears to play an important role in leading to the high particulate matter (PM) pollution since its contribution increases significantly as a function of aerosol mass loadings. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) of ACSM organic aerosol (OA) shows that the oxygenated OA (OOA) - a surrogate of secondary OA dominates OA composition throughout the day, on average accounting for 64\%, while the hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA) shows a large increase at meal times due to the local cooking emissions. Our results suggest that high PM pollution in Beijing associated with stagnant conditions and southern air masses is characterized by the high contribution of secondary inorganic species and OOA from regional scale, whereas the aerosol particles during the clean events are mainly contributed by the local emissions with organics and HOA being the dominant contribution. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

We estimated the statistically significant associations of reduced birth weight (b ¼ 15.9 g, 95\% CI: 26.8, 5.0) and LBW (OR ¼ 1.090, 95\% CI: 1.032, 1.150) with PM2.5 exposure (per 10 mg/m3 increment) during the entire pregnancy. Trimester-specific analyses showed negative associations between birth weight and PM2.5 exposure during the second (b ¼ 12.6 g) and third (b ¼ 10.0 g) trimesters. Other subgroup analyses indicated significantly different pooled-effect estimates of PM2.5 exposure on birth weight in studies with different exposure assessment methods, study designs and study settings. We further observed large differences in the pooled effect estimates of the PM2.5 chemical constituents for birth weight decrease and LBW. We concluded that PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy was associated with lower birth weight, and late pregnancy might be the critical window. Some specific PM2.5 constituents may have larger toxic effects on fetal weight. Exposure assessment methods, study designs and study settings might be important sources of the heterogeneity among the included studies.},

As a receptor-based model, positive matrix factorization (PMF) has been widely used for source apportionment of various environmental pollutants, such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs), heavy metals, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as well as inorganic cations and anions in the last decade. In this review, based on the papers mainly from 2008 to 2018 that focused on source apportionment of pollutants in different environmental media, we provide a comparison and summary of the source categories of typical environmental pollutants, with a special focus on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), apportioned using PMF. Based on the statistical average, coal combustion and vehicular emission, are shown to be the two most common sources of PAHs, and contribute much more to emissions than other sources, such as biomass burning, biogenic sources and waste incineration. Heavy metals were mainly from agricultural activities, industrial and vehicular emissions and mining activities. Quantitative source apportionment on pollutants such as VOCs and particulate matter were also apportioned, showing a prominent contribution from fossil-fuel combustion. We conclude that, aside from natural sources, abatement strategies should be focused on changes in energy structure and industrial activities, especially in China. Source apportionment of typical POPs including polychlorinated dibenzo-               p               -dioxins/dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) is less comprehensive and further study is required.},

  abstract = {Background: The implementation of emission mitigation policies in Europe over the last two decades has generally improved the air quality, which resulted in lower aerosol particle mass, particle number, and black carbon mass concentration. However, little is known whether the decreasing particle concentrations at a lower-altitude level can be observed in the free troposphere (FT), an important layer of the atmosphere, where aerosol particles have a longer lifetime and may affect climate dynamics. In this study, we used data from two high-Alpine observatories, Zugspitze-Schneefernerhaus (ZSF) and Jungfraujoch (JFJ), to assess the long-term trends on size-resolved particle number concentrations (PNCs) and equivalent black carbon (eBC) mass concentration separated for undisturbed lower FT conditions and under the influence of air from the planetary boundary layer (PBL) from 2009 to 2018. Results: The FT and PBL-influenced conditions were segregated for both sites. We found that the FT conditions in cold months were more prevalent than in warm months, while the measured aerosol parameters showed different seasonal patterns for the FT and PBL-influenced conditions. The pollutants in the PBL-influenced condition have a higher chance to be transported to high-altitudes due to the mountainous topography, leading to a higher concentration and more distinct seasonal variation, and vice versa. The long-term trends of the measured aerosol parameters were evaluated and the decreased aerosol concentrations were observed for both FT and PBL-influenced conditions. The observed decreasing trends in eBC concentration in the PBL-influenced condition are well consistent with the reported trends in total BC emission in Germany and Switzerland. The decreased concentrations in the FT condition suggest that the background aerosol concentration in the lower FT over Central Europe has correspondingly decreased. The change of back trajectories in the FT condition at ZSF and JFJ was further evaluated to investigate the other possible drivers for the decreasing trends. Conclusions: The background aerosol concentration in the lower FT over Central Europe has significantly decreased during 2009–2018. The implementation of emission mitigation policies is the most decisive factor and the decrease of the regional airmass occurrence over Central Europe also has contributed to the decreasing trends.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive chemical characterization and oxidative potential (OP) assessment of PM2.5 was carried out at an urban site of Budapest between June 2010 and May 2013 to investigate the seasonal variability of particulate phase air pollutants and their oxidative activity. Chemical analyses included the determination of the concentration of trace elements, major water-soluble inorganic ions and carbonaceous fractions (total carbon, water-soluble organic carbon, organic carbon, elemental carbon). The OP of PM2.5 was assessed by antioxidant depletion using a synthetic respiratory tract lining fluid containing ascorbate, reduced glutathione and urate. The mean PM2.5 mass concentration (21.0μgm-3) was just below the 25μgm-3 annual mean PM2.5 limit value set by the European Commission and showed a seasonal pattern with higher levels during winter. On average, 84\% of the gravimetric mass could be reconstructed by the chemical measurements. Organic matter and secondary inorganic ions were the most dominant PM2.5 constituents contributing 40 and 29\% of its mass, respectively. Changes in the yearly concentrations were not identified for the investigated compounds between 2010 and 2013. Temporal differences in both ascorbate and glutathione oxidation could be observed during the 3-year long sampling period; however, no clear seasonal trend was apparent. OP metrics were associated mainly with traffic-related trace elements; however, other PM sources (i.e., long-range transport, secondary aerosol formation) could also contribute to particulate OP in Budapest. The weak correlation between OP metrics and PM2.5 mass concentration suggests the possibility of using OP as an additional metric in epidemiology.},

The ability of the particles to deplete physiologically relevant antioxidants (ascorbic acid (AA), reduced glutathione (GSH)) in a synthetic respiratory tract lining fluid, i.e., oxidative potential (OP), was assessed. Furthermore, the link between particulate OP and the concentration of the PM constituents was investigated.The mean indoor PM2.5 mass concentration values were substantially lower than the related outdoor values with a mean indoor/outdoor PM2.5 mass concentration ratio of 0.62 and 0.61 for the summer and winter campaigns respectively. The OP of PM2.5 varied markedly across Europe with the highest outdoor OPAA m-3 and OPGSH m-3 (\% antioxidant depletion/m3 air) values obtained for Hungary, while PM2.5 collected in Finland exhibited the lowest values. Seasonal variation could be observed for both indoor and outdoor OPAA m-3 and OPGSH m-3 with higher mean values during winter. The indoor/outdoor OPAA m-3 and OPGSH m-3 ratios were less than one with 4 and 17 exceptions out of the 40 cases respectively. These results indicate that indoor air is generally less oxidatively challenging than outdoors. Correlation analysis revealed that trace elements play an important role in determining OP, in particular, the Cu content. Indoor air chemistry might affect OP since weaker correlations were obtained for indoor PM2.5. Our findings also suggest that office workers may be exposed to health relevant PM constituents to a different extent within the same building.},

  abstract = {The main objective of this study was chemical characterization and source apportionment of the oxidative potential of ambient PM 2.5 samples collected in an urban background area in Athens, Greece. Ambient PM 2.5 samples were collected during the summer (June–September) of 2017 and winter (February–March) of 2018 at a residential, urban background site in the outlying neighborhood of the Demokritos National Laboratory in Athens, Greece. The collected PM samples were analyzed for their chemical constituents including metals and trace elements, water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), elemental and organic carbon (EC/OC), and marker of biomass burning (i.e., levoglucosan). In addition, the DCFH in vitro assay was performed to determine the oxidative potential of the PM 2.5 samples. We performed a series of statistical analyses, including Spearman rank-order correlation analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and multi linear regression (MLR) to determine the most significant species (as source tracers) contributing to the oxidative potential of PM 2.5 . Our findings revealed that the intrinsic (per PM mass) and extrinsic (per m 3 of air volume) oxidative potentials of the collected ambient PM 2.5 samples were significantly higher than those measured in many urban areas around the world. The results of the MLR analyses indicated that the major pollution sources contributing to the oxidative potential of ambient PM 2.5 were vehicular emissions (characterized by EC) (44\%), followed by secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation (characterized by WSOC) (16\%), and biomass burning (characterized by levoglucosan) (9\%). The oxidative potential of the collected ambient PM 2.5 samples was also higher in summer compared to the winter, mainly due to higher concentrations of EC and WSOC during this season. Results from this study corroborate the impact of traffic and SOA on the oxidative potential of ambient PM 2.5 in greater Athens area, and can be helpful in adopting appropriate public health policies regarding detrimental outcomes of exposure to PM 2.5 .},

  abstract = {In order to study the pollution characteristics and main sources of fine particulate matter in the atmosphere of the city of Changchun, PM2.5 samples were collected during the four seasons in 2014, and representative months for each season are January, April, July, and October. Sample collection was carried out on 10 auto-monitoring stations in Changchun, and PM2.5 mass concentration and its chemical components (including inorganic elements, organic carbon, elemental carbon, and water-soluble ions) were measured. The results show that the annual average mass concentration of PM2.5 in Changchun in 2014 was about 66.77 μg/m3. Organic matter was the highest component in PM2.5, followed by secondary inorganic ions (SNA), mineral dust (MIN), elemental carbon (EC), and trace elements (TE). Positive matrix factorization (PMF) results gave seven factors, namely, industrial, biomass and coal burning, industrial and soil dust, motor vehicle, soil and secondary ion, light industrial, and hybrid automotive and industrial sources in PM2.5, with contributing values of 18.9\%, 24.2\%, 5.7\%, 23.0\%, 11.5\%, 13.0\%, and 3.6\%, respectively.},

To identify biological perturbations associated with particulate oxidative potential and examine the underlying molecular mechanisms, we recruited 54 participants from two dormitories near and far from a congested highway in Atlanta, GA. Fine particulate matter oxidative potential (“FPMOP”) levels at the dormitories were measured using dithiothreitol assay. Plasma and saliva samples were collected from participants four times for longitudinal high-resolution metabolic profiling. We conducted metabolome-wide association studies to identify metabolic signals with FPMOP. Leukotriene metabolism and galactose metabolism were top pathways associated with ≥5 FPMOP-related indicators in plasma, while vitamin E metabolism and leukotriene metabolism were found associated with most FPMOP indicators in saliva. We observed different patterns of perturbed pathways significantly associated with water-soluble and -insoluble FPMOPs, respectively. We confirmed five metabolites directly associated with FPMOP, including hypoxanthine, histidine, pyruvate, lactate/ glyceraldehyde, and azelaic acid, which were implications of perturbations in acute inflammation, nucleic acid damage and repair, and energy perturbation. The unique metabolic signals were specific to FPMOP, but not PM mass, providing initial indication that FPMOP might constitute a more sensitive, health-relevant measure for elucidating etiologies related to PM2.5 exposures.},

Exacerbation of pulmonary inflammation in susceptible people (e.g., asthmatics, COPD patients) appears to be a central mechanism by which PM exert their toxicity. Health effects are seen most consistently with PM with aerodynamic diameter {$<$} 2.5 μm (PM 2.5), although 10 μm {$<$} PM {$<$} 2.5 μm can also be toxic. Through its metal, semi-quinone, lipopolysaccaride, hydrocarbon, and ultrafine constituents, PM may exert oxidative stress on cells in the lung by presenting or by stimulating the cells to produce reactive oxygen (ROS). In vivo, PM increase cytokine and chemokine release, lung injury, and neutrophil influx. In vitro analysis of PM effects on the critical cellular targets, alveolar macrophages, epithelial cells, and neutrophils, demonstrates PM- and oxidant-dependent responses consistent with in vivo data. These effects have been observed with PM samples collected over years as well as concentrated PM2.5 (CAPs) collected in real time. Oxidative stress mediated by ROS is an important mechanism of PM-induced lung inflammation. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {The chemical and optical properties and sources of atmospheric PM2.5 humic-like substances (HULIS) were investigated from October to December 2016 in both industrial and suburban areas in Changzhou, China, during polluted and fair days. The average PM2.5 concentration in the industrial region was 113.06 (±64.3) µg m−3, higher than 85.27 (±41.56) µg m−3 at the suburban site. The frequency of polluted days was significantly higher in the industrial region. In contrast, the chemical compositions of PM2.5 at the two sampling sites exhibited no statistically significant differences. Rapidly increased secondary inorganic ions (SNA = NH4+ + SO42− + NO3−) concentrations suggested secondary formation played an important role in haze formation. The daily mean concentration of humic-like substance (HULIS) was 1.8–1.9 times that of HULIS-C (the carbon content of HULIS). Our results showed that HULIS accounted for a considerable fraction of PM2.5 (industrial region: 6.3\% vs. suburban region: 9.4\%). There were no large differences in the mass ratios of HULIS-C/WSOC at the two sites (46\% in the industrial region and 52\% in the suburban region). On average, suburban HULIS-C constituted 35.1\% of organic carbon (OC), higher than that (21.1\%) in the industrial region. Based on different MAE (mass absorption efficiency) values under different pollution levels, we can infer that the optical properties of HULIS varied with PM levels. Moreover, our results showed no distinct difference in E2/E3 (the ratio of light absorbance at 250 nm to that at 365 nm) and AAE300–400 (Absorption Angstrom Exponent at 300–400 nm) for HULIS and WSOC. the MAE365 (MAE at 365 nm) value of HULIS-C was different under three PM2.5 levels (low: PM2.5 {$<$} 75 µg m−3, moderate: PM2.5 = 75–150 µg m−3, high: PM2.5 {$>$} 150 µg m−3), with the highest MAE365 value on polluted days in the industrial region. Strong correlations between HULIS-C and SNA revealed that HULIS might be contributed from secondary formation at both sites. In addition, good correlations between HULIS-C with K+ in the industrial region implied the importance of biomass burning to PM2.5-bound HULIS. Three common sources of HULIS-C (i.e., vehicle emissions, biomass burning, and secondary aerosols) were identified by positive matrix factorization (PMF) for both sites, but the contributions were different, with the largest contribution from biomass burning in the industrial region and secondary sources in the suburban region, respectively. The findings presented here are important in understanding PM2.5 HULIS chemistry and are valuable for future air pollution control measures.},

  abstract = {Using daily fine particulate matter (PM2.5) composition data from the 2000e2005 U.S. EPA Chemical Speciation Network (CSN) for over 200 sites, we applied multivariate methods to identify and quantify the major fine particulate matter (PM2.5) source components in the U.S. Novel aspects of this work were: (1) the application of factor analysis (FA) to multi-city daily data, drawing upon both spatial and temporal variations of chemical species; and, (2) the exclusion of secondary components (sulfates, nitrates and organic carbon) from the source identification FA to more clearly discern and apportion the PM2.5 mass to primary emission source categories. For the quantification of source-related mass, we considered two approaches based upon the FA results: 1) using single key tracers for sources identified by FA in a mass regression; and, 2) applying Absolute Principal Component Analysis (APCA). In each case, we followed a two-stage mass regression approach, in which secondary components were first apportioned among the identified sources, and then mass was apportioned to the sources and to other secondary mass not explained by the individual sources. The major U.S. PM2.5 source categories identified via FA (and their key tracers) were: Metals Industry (Pb, Zn); Crustal/Soil Particles (Ca, Si); Motor Vehicle Traffic (EC, NO2); Steel Industry (Fe, Mn); Coal Combustion (As, Se); Oil Combustion (V, Ni); Salt Particles (Na, Cl) and Biomass Burning (K). Nationwide spatial plots of the source-related PM2.5 impacts were confirmatory of the factor interpretations: ubiquitous sources, such as Traffic and Soil, were found to be spread across the nation, more unique sources (such as Steel and Metals Processing) being highest in select industrialized cities, Biomass Burning was highest in the U.S. Northwest, while Residual Oil combustion was highest in cities in the Northeastern U.S. and in cities with major seaports. The sum of these source contributions and the secondary PM2.5 components agreed well with the U.S. PM2.5 observed during the study period (mean ¼ 14.3 mg m3; R2 ¼ 0.94). Apportionment regression analyses using single-element tracers for each source category gave results consistent with the APCA estimates. Comparisons of nearby sites indicated that the PM2.5 mass and the secondary aerosols were most homogenous spatially, while traffic PM2.5 and its tracer, EC, were among the most spatially representative of the source-related components. Comparison of apportionment results to a previous analysis of the 1979e1982 IP Network revealed similar and correlated major U.S. source category factors, albeit at lower levels than in the earlier period, suggesting a consistency in the U.S. spatial patterns of these source-related exposures over time, as well. These results indicate that applying source-apportionment methods to the nationwide CSN can be an informative avenue for identifying and quantifying source components for the subsequent estimation of source-specific health effects, potentially contributing to more efficient regulation of PM2.5.},

The ‘lasso’ minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree‐based models are briefly described.},

Here we report the chemical characterization of non-refractory submicron aerosol and source apportionment of the organic fraction by positive matrix factorization (PMF). In contrast to other long-term source apportionment studies, we let a small PMF window roll over the dataset instead of performing PMF over the full dataset or on separate seasons. In this way, the seasonal variation in the source profiles can be captured. The uncertainties in the PMF solutions are addressed by the bootstrap resampling strategy and the random a-value approach for constrained factors.},

Mean total concentrations (G + P) of PAHs and oxy-PAHs were in the same range and about 10 ng m− 3. Nitro-PAHs were 50 to 100 times less concentrated averaging 100 pg m− 3. Polycyclic aromatic compound (PAC) concentrations were 5 to 7 times higher in “cold” period (October to March) than in “warm” period (April to September). Seasonal variations may be explained by higher primary emissions from residential heating, especially biomass burning in “cold” season. Meteorological conditions and influence of the geomorphology around Grenoble, with the formation of thermal inversion layers leading to the stagnation of pollutants, were additional key parameters. Maximum individual PAC concentrations were observed during two PM10 pollution events in December and February–March. Chemical processes and secondary formation of oxy- and nitro-PAH were probably enhanced by the accumulation of the pollutants during these events. PAC gas/particle partitioning depended on compound molecular weight and vapour pressure. Gas/particle partitioning of oxy- and nitro-PAHs were evaluated using a multi-phase poly-parameter linear free energy relationship model. The PAC cancer risk was assessed using toxic equivalency factors available in the literature (19 PAHs, 10 nitro-PAHs and 1 oxy-PAH). Overall, particle-bound PACs contributed about 76\% of the cancer risk. While PAHs accounted for most of the total PAC cancer risk, oxy- and nitro-PAHs could account for up to 24\%. The risk quantification across substance classes is limited by toxicological data availability.},

The results indicated that their concentrations were strongly affected by primary emissions in cold period, especially from residential heating (i.e. biomass burning). Besides, secondary processes occurred in summer but also in cold period under specific conditions such as during long thermal inversion layer periods and severe PM pollution events. Different secondary processes were involved during both PM pollution events observed in March–April and in December 2013. During the first one, long range transport of air masses, nitrate chemistry and secondary nitro-PAH formation seemed linked. During the second one, the accumulation of primary pollutants over several consecutive days enhanced secondary chemical processes notably highlighted by the dramatic increase of oxy-PAH concentrations. The study of the time trends of ratios of individual nitro- or oxy-PAHs to parent PAHs, in combination with key primary or secondary aerosol species and literature data, allowed the identification of potential molecular markers of PAH oxidation. Finally, 6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one, biphenyl-2,2’-dicarboxaldehyde and 3-nitrophenanthrene have been selected to be the best candidates as markers of PAH oxidation processes in ambient air.},

The goal of such analyses is to partition explained variance among multiple predictors to better understand the role played by each predictor in a regression equation. Unfortunately, when predictors are correlated, typically relied upon metrics are flawed indicators of variable importance. To that end, we highlight the key benefits of two relative importance analyses, dominance analysis and relative weight analysis, over estimates produced by multiple regression analysis. We also describe numerous situations where relative importance weights should be used, while simultaneously cautioning readers about the limitations and misconceptions regarding the use of these weights. Finally, we present step-by-step recommendations for researchers interested in incorporating these analyses in their own work and point them to available web resources to assist them in producing these weights.},

  abstract = {Background: There is limited evidence on whether particulate matter (PM) can augment the progression of atherosclerosis; furthermore, the specific attributes of PM responsible for health effects are unclear. We developed models to predict exposure to PM 10 m (PM10) and also to predict a measure of oxidative potential (the capacity of particles to induce oxidative damage). Our objectives were (1) to estimate the association between PM10 and carotid intima-media thickness, a measure of subclinical atherosclerosis, and (2) to compare this association with that of PM10 weighted by its oxidative potential (PM10*OP). Methods: Analysis was based on 2348 participants of the Whitehall II cohort of British civil servants who had intima-media thickness measured between 2003 and 2005 and lived in Greater London. Weekly PM10 and PM10*OP were predicted at each participant’s residence. Primary exposure metrics were defined as PM10 and PM10*OP averaged over the year before scan.

Results: An interquartile range increase (5.2 gm3) in PM10 was associated with a 5.0\% (95\% confidence interval  1.9\% to 8.3\%) increase in intima-media thickness after covariate adjustment. The association for an interquartile range change in PM10*OP (1.5 m3) was weaker: 1.2\% (0.2\% to 2.2\%). Conclusions: These findings support a relationship between PM exposure and atherosclerosis.

  abstract = {Near real-time atmospheric particulate matter (PM) monitors are extensively used in air quality networks given their ability to provide continuous measurements with minimal attention by the operator. Their principle of operation is based on measurement of a physical parameter that is quantitatively linked to the PM mass concentration. Significant discrepancies between these measurements and those obtained by the reference gravimetric method, conducted in regions with diverse climatic conditions, have been reported in the literature. In this study we compare systematic PM2.5 and PM10 gravimetric (GM) and beta attenuation (BA) measurements performed at a suburban site in Athens, Greece, over a period of 4 years (2009-2012). In general, BA and GM datasets exhibited similar temporal variation for both PM size fractions. An overestimation of the ΒΑ measurements, which was 30\% for the PM2.5 and 10\% for the PM10 data, was observed. Good linear correlations between GM and BA data were observed, with estimated Pearson coefficients being 0.79 for the PM2.5 and 0.85 for the PM10 measurements. The respective fitted equations through the entire dataset were BA = 0.71 GM+6.2, and BA = 0.77 G M+4.1. Better correlation between GM and BA measurements was observed during the cold rather than the warm period. Discrepancies between BA and GM PM2.5 measurements increased with increasing available water vapor, suggesting that the aerosol bound water has a strong effect on the measurements. The effect of filter material used for GM measurements (i.e., quartz, glass fiber, or Teflon) was also examined for the PM2.5 dataset. Best correlation between BA and GM data was observed when glass fiber, which is incidentally the material of the BA filter tape, was used in the GM measurements. When the BA to GM relationship was examined by further categorizing the data by the season (i.e., cold and warm period) for different filter types, the relationships that were fitted to the data for the two seasons were similar when Teflon filters were used, but quite diverse when quartz and glass fiber filters were employed in the GM measurements. Finally, the variability of the ratio between the two measurement techniques was found to be potentially dependent on the availability of the volatility or stability in the aerosol phase of species such as ammonium nitrate.},

This colloquium was followed by meetings with scientists from EPA, state agencies and the broader scientific community (Bangs 2005a; Bangs 2005b; Dellarco and Bangs 2006), at which the intention to update the Guidelines for Exposure Assessment was announced and developments in the field since 1992 were reviewed. In 2006, the Agency consulted with the EPA Science Advisory Board, describing its approach to the update and summarizing comments received from Agency scientists, the scientific community and the public. This update, the Guidelines for Human Exposure Assessment, benefits from many additional years of experience with exposure and risk assessments across the Agency, conversations with the broader scientific community and products from the Science Advisory Board and the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences.},

As a “first look” at this data set, analysis of samples collected from summer 2005 to spring 2006 demonstrates the utility of continuous sampling to characterize air masses over the ice pack, document individual aerosol transport events, and develop a long-term record. Seven source-related aerosol types were identified in this analysis: Asian dust, Saharan dust, industrial combustion, marine with combustion tracers, fresh coarse volcanic tephra, and aged volcanic plume with fine tephra and sulfate, and the well-mixed background “Arctic haze”. The Saharan dust is a new discovery; the other types are consistent with those reported from previous work using snow pits and intermittent ambient air sampling during intensive study campaigns. Continuous sampling complements the fundamental characterization of Greenland aerosols developed in intensive field programs by providing a year-round record of aerosol size and composition at all temporal scales relevant to ice core analysis, ranging from individual deposition events and seasonal cycles, to a record of inter-annual variability of aerosols from both natural and anthropogenic sources.},

A multisite positive matrix factorization analysis was used to compare the source contributions between the two stations, while the trends for both the chemical species and source contributions were studied using the Theil–Sen trend estimator. Between 2009 and 2018, both stations showed a statistically significant decrease in PM2.5 concentrations, which was driven by the downward trends of levels of chemical species and anthropogenic source contributions, mainly from heavy oil combustion, mixed combustion, industry, and secondary sulfate. These source contributions showed a continuous decrease over the study period, signifying the continuing success of mitigation strategies, although the trends of heavy oil combustion and secondary sulfate have flattened since 2016. Secondary nitrate also followed a significant decreasing trend in BCN, while secondary organic aerosols (SOA) very slightly decreased in MSY. The observed decreasing trends, in combination with the absence of a trend for the organic aerosols (OA) at both stations, resulted in an increase in the relative proportion of OA in PM2.5 by 12\% in BCN and 9\% in MSY, mostly from SOA, which increased by 7\% in BCN and 4\% in MSY. Thus, at the end of the study period, OA accounted for 40\% and 50\% of the annual mean PM2.5 at BCN and MSY, respectively. This might have relevant implications for air quality policies aiming at abating PM2.5 in the study region and for possible changes in toxicity of PM2.5 due to marked changes in composition and source apportionment.},

  abstract = {Ambient particulate matter (PM) is a major contributor to air pollution, leading to adverse health effects on the human population. It has been suggested that the oxidative potential (OP, as a tracer of oxidative stress) of PM is a possible determinant of its health impact. In this study, samples of PM10, PM2.5, and PM1 were collected roughly every four days from January 2018 until March 2019 at a Barcelona urban background site and Montseny rural background site in northeastern Spain. We determined the chemical composition of samples, allowing us to perform source apportionment using positive matrix factorization. The OP of PM was determined by measuring reactive oxygen species using dithiothreitol and ascorbic acid assays. Finally, to link the sources with the measured OP, both a Pearson's correlation and a multiple linear regression model were applied to the dataset. The results showed that in Barcelona, the OP of PM10 was much higher than those of PM2.5 and PM1, whereas in Montseny results for all PM sizes were in the same range, but significantly lower than in Barcelona. In Barcelona, several anthropogenic sources were the main drivers of OP in PM10 (Combustion + Road Dust + Heavy Oil + OC-rich) and PM2.5 (Road Dust + Combustion). In contrast, PM1 -associated OP was driven by Industry, with a much lower contribution to PM10 and PM2.5 mass. Meanwhile, Montseny exhibited no clear drivers for OP evolution, likely explaining the lack of a significant difference in OP between PM10, PM2.5, and PM1. Overall, this study indicates that size fraction matters for OP, as a function of the environment typology. In an urban context, OP is driven by the PM10 and PM1 size fractions, whereas only the PM1 fraction is involved in rural environments.},

Experimental data have also shown that such exposure elicits adverse reproductive outcomes. We hypothesized that the effects of urban air pollution on pregnancy outcomes could be related to changes in functional morphology of the placenta. To test this, future dams were exposed during pregestational and gestational periods to filtered or nonfiltered air in exposure chambers. Placentas were collected from near-term pregnancies and prepared for microscopical examination. Fields of view on vertical uniform random tissue slices were analyzed using stereological methods. Volumes of placental compartments were estimated, and the labyrinth was analyzed further in terms of its maternal vascular spaces, fetal capillaries, trophoblast, and exchange surface areas. From these primary data, secondary quantities were derived: vessel calibers (expressed as diameters), trophoblast thickness (arithmetic mean), and total and massspecific morphometric diffusive conductances for oxygen of the intervascular barrier. Two-way analysis of variance showed that both periods of exposure led to significantly smaller fetal weights. Pregestational exposure to nonfiltered air led to significant increases in fetal capillary surface area and in total and mass-specific conductances. However, the calibers of maternal blood spaces were reduced. Gestational exposure to nonfiltered air was associated with reduced volumes, calibers, and surface areas of maternal blood spaces and with greater fetal capillary surfaces and diffusive conductances. The findings indicate that urban air pollution affects placental functional morphology. Fetal weights are compromised despite attempts to improve diffusive transport across the placenta.},

Using exposure chambers receiving filtered (F) and non-filtered (NF) air, we observed that exposed females exhibited changes in the length of estrus cycle and extended estrus and, therefore, a reduction in the number of cycles during the studied period (F 2.670.22 and NF 1.270.29, p ¼ 0.03). The mean number of antral follicles declined by 36\% (p ¼ 0.04) in NF mice (75735.2) compared to F mice (118.6718.4). Our results further indicate a significant increase in time necessary for mating and decreased fertility and pregnancy indices (p ¼ 0.003) in NF couples. Mean post-implantation loss rates were increased by 70\% (pp0.005) in the NF2 group (exposed before and during pregnancy to NF air) compared to the F1 group (exposed before and during pregnancy to F air) and were influenced by both pre-gestational (po0.004) and gestational (po0.01) period exposure. Fetal weight was significantly higher in the F1 group when compared with the other groups (po0.001), at a 20\% higher weight in the F1 group (0.8670.18 g) than in the NF2 group (0.6870.10 g). Furthermore, fetal weight was influenced by both pre-gestational and gestational period exposure, and a significant interaction between these two factors was found (po0.001). This study demonstrated that exposure to ambient levels of urban traffic-generated particulate matter negatively affects different functions and stages of the reproductive process. Our results also reinforce the idea that maternal exposure to air pollution is linked to negative pregnancy outcomes, even if the exposure occurs only before conception.},

  abstract = {We assess the potential of the water-soluble fraction of atmospheric fine aerosols in the southeastern United States to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and identify major ROS-associated emission sources. ROS-generation potential of particles was quantified by the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay and involved analysis of fine particulate matter (PM) extracted from high-volume quartz filters (23 h integrated samples) collected at various sites in different environmental settings in the southeast, including three urban-Atlanta sites, in addition to a rural site. Paired sampling was conducted with one fixed site in Atlanta (Jefferson Street), representative of the urban environment, with the others rotating among different sites, for ∼250 days between June 2012 and September 2013 (N Combining double low line483). A simple linear regression between the DTT activity and aerosol chemical components revealed strong associations between PM ROS-generation potential and secondary organic aerosol (WSOC - water-soluble organic carbon) in summer, and biomass burning markers in winter. Redox-active metals were also somewhat correlated with the DTT activity, but mostly at urban and roadside sites. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) was applied to apportion the relative contribution of various sources to the ROS-generation potential of water-soluble PM2.5 in urban Atlanta. PMF showed that vehicular emissions contribute uniformly throughout the year (12-25\%), while secondary oxidation processes dominated the DTT activity in summer (46\%) and biomass burning in winter (47\%). Road dust was significant only during drier periods (∼12\% in summer and fall). Source apportionment by chemical mass balance (CMB) was reasonably consistent with PMF, but with higher contribution from vehicular emissions (32\%). Given the spatially large data set of PM sampled over an extended period, the study reconciles the results from previous work that showed only region- or season-specific aerosol components or sources contributing to PM ROS activity, possibly due to smaller sample sizes. The ubiquitous nature of the major sources of PM-associated ROS suggests widespread population exposures to aerosol components that have the ability to catalyze the production of oxidants in vivo.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Particulate matter (PM) has become a major concern in terms of human health and climate impact. In particular, the source apportionment (SA) of organic aerosols (OA) present in submicron particles (PM1) has gained relevance as an atmospheric research field due to the diversity and complexity of its primary sources and secondary formation processes. Moreover, relatively simple but robust instruments such as the Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM) are now widely available for the near-real-time online determination of the composition of the non-refractory PM1. One of the most used tools for SA purposes is the source-receptor positive matrix factorisation (PMF) model. Even though the recently developed rolling PMF technique has already been used for OA SA on ACSM datasets, no study has assessed its added value compared to the more common seasonal PMF method using a practical approach yet. In this paper, both techniques were applied to a synthetic dataset and to nine European ACSM datasets in order to spot the main output discrepancies between methods. The main advantage of the synthetic dataset approach was that the methods' outputs could be compared to the expected “true” values, i.e.~the original synthetic dataset values. This approach revealed similar apportionment results amongst methods, although the rolling PMF profile's adaptability feature proved to be advantageous, as it generated output profiles that moved nearer to the truth points. Nevertheless, these results highlighted the impact of the profile anchor on the solution, as the use of a different anchor with respect to the truth led to significantly different results in both methods. In the multi-site study, while differences were generally not significant when considering year-long periods, their importance grew towards shorter time spans, as in intra-month or intra-day cycles. As far as correlation with external measurements is concerned, rolling PMF performed better than seasonal PMF globally for the ambient datasets investigated here, especially in periods between seasons. The results of this multi-site comparison coincide with the synthetic dataset in terms of rolling–seasonal similarity and rolling PMF reporting moderate improvements. Altogether, the results of this study provide solid evidence of the robustness of both methods and of the overall efficiency of the recently proposed rolling PMF approach.},

  abstract = {Source apportionment (SA) techniques allocate the measured ambient pollutants with their potential source origin; thus, they are a powerful tool for designing air pollution mitigation strategies. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) is one of the most widely used SA approaches, and its multi-time resolution (MTR) methodology, which enables mixing different instrument data in their original time resolution, was the focus of this study. One year of co-located measurements in Barcelona, Spain, of non-refractory submicronic particulate matter (NR-PM1), black carbon (BC) and metals were obtained by a Q-ACSM (Aerodyne Research Inc.), an aethalometer (Aerosol d.o.o.) and fine offline quartz-fibre filters, respectively. These data were combined in a MTR PMF analysis preserving the high time resolution (30 min for the NR-PM1 and BC, and 24 h every 4th day for the offline samples). The MTR-PMF outcomes were assessed varying the time resolution of the high-resolution data subset and exploring the error weightings of both subsets. The time resolution assessment revealed that averaging the high-resolution data was disadvantageous in terms of model residuals and environmental interpretability. The MTR-PMF resolved eight PM1 sources: ammonium sulphate + heavy oil combustion (25\%), ammonium nitrate + ammonium chloride (17\%), aged secondary organic aerosol (SOA) (16\%), traffic (14\%), biomass burning (9\%), fresh SOA (8\%), cooking-like organic aerosol (5\%), and industry (4\%). The MTR-PMF technique identified two more sources relative to the 24 h base case data subset using the same species and four more with respect to the pseudo-conventional approach mimicking offline PMF, indicating that the combination of both high and low TR data is significantly beneficial for SA. Besides the higher number of sources, the MTR-PMF technique has enabled some sources disentanglement compared to the pseudo-conventional and base case PMF as well as the characterisation of their intra-day patterns.},

  abstract = {Despite the increase of commercial shipping around the world, data are yet relatively scarce on the contribution of these emissions to ambient air particulates. One of the reasons is the complexity in the detection and estimation of shipping contributions to ambient particulates in harbor and urban environments, given the similarity with tracers of other combustion sources. This study aimed to identify specific tracers of shipping emissions in a Mediterranean city with an important harbor (Melilla, Spain). Results showed that, for 24 h PM10 and PM2.5 samples, valid tracers of commercial shipping emissions were ratios of V/Ni = 4-5 and V/EC {$<$} 2, whereas V/EC {$>$} 8 excluded the influence of shipping emissions. Other ratios (V/S, La/Ce, Zn/Ni, Pb/Zn, OC/EC) and tracers (Pb, Zn) were also tested but did not correlate with this source. Due to the changing composition of diesel fuels, tracers in the Mediterranean Sea may not be representative in other regions of the world and vice versa. The contribution of shipping emissions to ambient particulate matter (PM) urban background levelswasquantified by positive matrix factorization (PMF), resulting in 2\% and 4\% of mean annual PM10 levels (0.8 μg/m3 primary particles and 1.7 μg/m3 secondary particles, with 20\% uncertainty) and 14\% of mean annual PM 2.5 levels (2.6 μg/m3). © 2009 American Chemical Society.},

  abstract = {Oxidative potential (OP) is an emerging health-related metric which integrates several physicochemical properties of particulate matter (PM) that are involved in the pathogenesis of the diseases resulting from exposure to PM. Daily PM2.5-fraction aerosol samples collected in the rural background of the Carpathian Basin and in the suburban area and centre of its largest city of Budapest in each season over 1 year were utilised to study the OP at the related locations for the first time. The samples were analysed for particulate matter mass, main carbonaceous species, levoglucosan and 20 chemical elements. The resulting data sets were subjected to positive matrix factorisation to derive the main aerosol sources. Biomass burning (BB), suspended dust, road traffic, oil combustion mixed with coal combustion and long-range transport, vehicle metal wear, and mixed industrial sources were identified. The OP of the sample extracts in simulated lung fluid was determined by ascorbic acid (AA) and dithiothreitol (DTT) assays. The comparison of the OP data sets revealed some differences in the sensitivities of the assays. In the heating period, both the OP and PM mass levels were higher than in spring and summer, but there was a clear misalignment between them. In addition, the heating period : non-heating period OP ratios in the urban locations were larger than for the rural background by factors of 2–4. The OP data sets were attributed to the main aerosol sources using multiple linear regression with the weighted least squares approach. The OP was unambiguously dominated by BB at all sampling locations in winter and autumn. The joint effects of motor vehicles involving the road traffic and vehicle metal wear played the most important role in summer and spring, with considerable contributions from oil combustion and resuspended dust. In winter, there is temporal coincidence between the most severe daily PM health limit exceedances in the whole Carpathian Basin and the chemical PM composition causing larger OP. Similarly, in spring and summer, there is a spatial coincidence in Budapest between the urban hotspots of OP-active aerosol constituents from traffic and the high population density in central quarters. These features offer possibilities for more efficient season-specific air quality regulations focusing on well-selected aerosol sources or experimentally determined OP, rather than on PM mass in general.},

  abstract = {In this work, the source of ambient particulate matter (PM10) collected over a one-year period at an urban background site in Lens (France) was determined and investigated using a positive matrix factorization receptor model (US EPA PMF v3.0). In addition, a potential source contribution function (PSCF) was performed by means of the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (Hysplit) v4.9 model to assess prevailing geographical origins of the identified sources. A selective iteration process was followed for the qualification of the more robust and meaningful PMF solution. Components measured and used in the PMF included inorganic and organic species: soluble ionic species, trace elements, elemental carbon (EC), sugar alcohols, sugar anhydride, and organic carbon (OC). The mean PM10 concentration measured from March 2011 to March 2012 was about 21 μgm-3 with typically OM, nitrate and sulfate contributing to most of the mass and accounting respectively for 5.8, 4.5 and 2.3 μgm-3 on a yearly basis. Accordingly, PMF outputs showed that the main emission sources were (in decreasing order of contribution) secondary inorganic aerosols (28\% of the total PM10 mass), aged marine emissions (19\%), with probably predominant contribution of shipping activities, biomass burning (13\%), mineral dust (13\%), primary biogenic emissions (9\%), fresh sea salts (8\%), primary traffic emissions (6\%) and heavy oil combustion (4\%). Significant temporal variations were observed for most of the identified sources. In particular, biomass burning emissions were negligible in summer but responsible for about 25\% of total PM10 and 50\% of total OC in wintertime. Conversely, primary biogenic emissions were found to be negligible in winter but to represent about 20\% of total PM10 and 40\% of total OC in summer. The latter result calls for more investigations of primary biogenic aerosols using source apportionment studies, which quite usually disregard this type of source. This study further underlines the major influence of secondary processes during daily threshold exceedances. Finally, apparent discrepancies that could be generally observed between filter-based studies (such as the present one) and aerosol mass spectrometer-based PMF analyses (organic fractions) are also discussed. © Author(s) 2014.},

  abstract = {Source apportionment is typically performed on chemical composition data derived from particulate matter (PM) samples. However, many common sources no longer emit significant amounts of characteristic trace elements requiring the use of more comprehensive chemical characterization in order to fully resolve the PM sources. Positive matrix factorization (EPA PMF, version 4.1) was used to analyze 24-hr integrated molecular marker (MM), secondary inorganic ions, trace elements, carbonaceous species and light absorption data to investigate sources of PM2.5 in Rochester, New York between October 2009 and October 2010 to explore the role of specific MMs. An eight-factor solution was found for which the factors were identified as isoprene secondary organic aerosol (SOA), airborne soil, other SOA, diesel emissions, secondary sulfate, wood combustion, gasoline vehicle, and secondary nitrate contributing 6.9\%, 12.8\%, 3.7\%, 7.8\%, 45.5\%, 9.1\%, 7.9\%, and 6.3\% to the average PM2.5 concentration, respectively Concentrations of pentacosane, hexacosane, heptacosane, and octacosane in the gasoline vehicles factor were larger compared to diesel emissions. Aethalometer Delta-C was strongly associated with wood combustion. The compounds, n-heptacosanoic acid and n-octacosanoic acid, occasionally used in the past as tracers for road dust, were found to largely associate with SOA in this study. In comparison with a standard PMF analyses without MM, inclusion of them was necessary to resolve SOA and wood combustion factors in urban areas. Ó 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) are major constituents of PM2.5 and their source apportionment remains a challenging task due to the great diversity of their sources and lack of source-specific tracer data. In this work, sources of OC and EC are investigated using positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis of PM2.5 chemical composition data, including major ions, OC, EC, elements, and organic molecular source markers, for a set of 156 filter samples collected over three years from 2010 to 2012 at Dongguan in the Pearl River Delta, China. The key organic tracers include levoglucosan, mannosan, hopanes, C27-C33n-alkanes, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Using these species as input for the PMF model, nine factors were resolved. Among them, biomass burning and coal combustion were significant sources contributing 15-17\% of OC and 24-30\% and 34-35\% of EC, respectively. Industrial emissions and ship emissions, identified through their characteristic metal signatures, contributed 16-24\% and 7-8\% of OC and 8-11\% and 16-17\% of EC, respectively. Vehicle exhaust was a less significant source, accounting for 3-4\% of OC and 5-8\% of EC. Secondary OC, taken to be the sum of OC present in secondary sulfate and nitrate formation source factors, made up 27-36\% of OC. Plastic burning, identified through 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene as a tracer, was a less important source for OC(≤4\%) and EC (5-10\%), but a significant source for PAHs at this site.The utility of organic source tracers was demonstrated by comparing PMF runs with different combinations of organic tracers removed from the input species list. Levoglucosan and mannosan were important additions to distinguish biomass burning from coal combustion by reducing collinearity among source profiles. Inclusion of hopanes and 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene was found to be necessary in resolving the less significant sources vehicle exhaust and plastic burning. Inclusion of C27-C33n-alkanes and PAHs can influence the source profiles resolved by PMF and thereby affect the source contributions to OC and EC. Considerably more OC (44\% vs. 27\% of OC) was apportioned to the secondary factors when only major components were considered in comparison with the PMF analysis with the full suite of organic tracers, mainly at the expense of coal combustion and industrial emissions. EC apportionment to the few major combustion sources was found more sensitive to inclusion of organic tracers than OC apportionment, with PAHs playing a prominent role. This work demonstrates the importance of having distinct organic tracers in identifying and quantifying OC and EC sources.},

Two pairs of Teflon (T1/T2) and Quartz (Q1/Q2) samples were obtained, for a total number of 1352 valid filters. Results showed elevated pollution in Beijing, with an annual mean PM2.5 mass concentration of 102 μg/m3. According to the calculated PM2.5 mass concentration, 50\% of our sampling days were acceptable (PM2.5 {$<$} 75 μg/m3), 30\% had slight/medium pollution (75-150 μg/m3), and 7\% had severe pollution ({$>$} 250 μg/m3). Sampling interruption occurred frequently for the Teflon filter group (75\%) in severe pollution periods, resulting in important data being missing. Further analysis showed that high PM2.5 combined with high relative humidity (RH) gave rise to the interruptions. The seasonal variation of PM2.5 was presented, with higher monthly average mass concentrations in winter (peak value in February, 422 μg/m3), and lower in summer (7 μg/m3 in June). From May to August, the typical summer period, least severe pollution events were observed, with high precipitation levels accelerating the process of wet deposition to remove PM2.5. The case of February presented the most serious pollution, with monthly averaged PM2.5 of 181 μg/m3 and 32\% of days with severe pollution. The abundance of PM2.5 in winter could be related to increased coal consumption for heating needs.},

  abstract = {Background: Particulate matter (PM) is a high risk factor for various respiratory diseases and triggers an inflammatory response in lung tissues. However, the molecular mechanism of the PM-induced inflammatory response is incompletely understood. Methods: Human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) were treated with the urban PM 1649b for assessment of the inflammatory response. The intracellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured by flow cytometry. PM-activated signaling pathways were addressed with specific inhibitors. In vivo, the C57 mice model of PM-induced acute lung inflammation was established with intratracheal instillation of PM for 2 consecutive days. The oxidant stress in lung tissues was assessed with dihydroethidium (DHE) staining, and malondialdehyde (MDA) activity and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) assays. The histopathologic changes in lung tissues and number of inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were examined. Expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in BALF was measured by ELISA. Results: PM increased the expression of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)9 and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in a dose-dependent manner. ROS generation and activation of MAPK (ERK, JNK, p38 MAPK) and NF-κB pathways were detected in PM-exposed HBECs. Pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) led to the inflammatory response, ROS level and activation of the MAPK and NF-κB pathways to be attenuated. Blockade of ERK, JNK or p38 MAPK pathway with specific inhibitor prevented the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of the NF- κB pathway. Inhibition of the NF-κB pathway reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In vivo, PM exposure increased oxidant stress in lung tissues, infiltration of inflammatory cells around PM in lung tissues, the number of total cells and inflammatory cells in BALF, and the concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and MMP-9 in BALF, all of which were reversed partially upon NAC treatment. Conclusions: PM exposure enhanced the airway inflammatory response significantly through ROSmediated activation of MAPK (ERK, JNK, p38 MAPK) and downstream NF- κB signaling pathways. Oxidative stress appeared to be the key regulator for PM-induced lung inflammation. These results suggested the molecular mechanism of lung inflammation caused by PM.},

  abstract = {Owing to the complex nature and dynamic behaviors of secondary organic aerosol (SOA), its ability to cause oxidative stress (known as oxidative potential, or OP) and adverse health outcomes remains poorly understood. In this work, we probed the linkages between the chemical composition of SOA and its OP, and investigated impacts from various SOA evolution pathways, including atmospheric oligomerization, heterogeneous oxidation, and mixing with metal. SOA formed from photooxidation of the two most common polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (naphthalene and phenanthrene) were studied as model systems. OP was evaluated using the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay. The oligomer-rich fraction separated by liquid chromatography dominates DTT activity in both SOA systems (52 ± 10 \% for naphthalene SOA (NSOA), and 56 ± 5 \% for phenanthrene SOA (PSOA)). Heterogeneous ozonolysis of NSOA was found to enhance its OP, which is consistent with the trend observed in selected individual oxidation products. DTT activities from redox-active organic compounds and metals were found to be not additive. When mixing with highly redox-active metal (Cu), OP of the mixture decreased significantly for 1,2-naphthoquinone (42 ± 7 \%), 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene (35 ± 1 \%), NSOA (50 ± 6 \%), and PSOA (43 ± 4 \%). Evidence from proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy illustrates that such OP reduction upon mixing can be ascribed to metal-organic binding interactions. Our results highlight the role of aerosol chemical composition under atmospheric aging processes in determining the OP of SOA, which is needed for more accurate and explicit prediction of the toxicological impacts from particulate matter.},

The abundance of total saccharides showed no clear seasonal variation, but apparent distinctions on the levels of the three categories and individual saccharide compounds were found. Primary sugars and particularly sucrose were dominant in summer. In contrast, levoglucosan was the predominant species in winter, contributing 60\% of total saccharides. Source apportionment by positive matrix factorization revealed that airborne pollen was a major source of PM2.5 associated-saccharides in summer, accounting for 35\% of total saccharides; while biomass burning activities contributed to 60\% of the winter saccharides. Furthermore, an increasing trend of biomass/biofuel burning contribution to winter PM2.5 was observed in comparison with previous studies in Xi'an, suggesting a change in emission sources may be underway in northwestern China.},

  abstract = {The exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) can induce oxidative stress, contributing to global burden of diseases. The evaluation of the oxidative potential (OP) of PM2.5 is thus critical for the health risk assessment. We collected ambient PM2.5 samples in Hangzhou city, China for four consecutive quarters in the year 2017 and investigated the oxidation property of PM2.5 components by the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay. The annual mean of ambient PM2.5 mass concentrations in 2017 was 63.05 μg m−3 (median: 57.34, range: 6.67–214.33 μg m−3) with the significant seasonal variations ranking as winter {$>$} spring {$>$} summer {$>$} autumn. Secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) species including SO42−, NO3− and NH4+ totally account for {$>$}50\% of PM2.5 mass. The annual mean volume-normalized DTT activity (DTTv) showed a relatively high value of 0.62 nmol/min/m3 (median: 0.62, range: 0.11–1.66 nmol/min/m3) and DTTv of four seasons was roughly at the same level, indicating a high annual exposure level of ambient PM2.5. SIA species were correlated well with the corresponding DTTv and showed significant diurnal variations with strong or moderate correlations at day and weak correlations at night, suggesting strong secondary formation in daytime with contribution to the particulate OP. The annual mean mass-normalized DTT activity (DTTm) had a relatively low value of 6.39 pmol/min/μg (median: 5.63, range: 1.99–22.70 pmol/min/μg), indicating low intrinsic oxidative toxicity. The DTTm of four seasons ranked as autumn {$>$} winter {$>$} spring {$>$} summer, indicating seasonal variations of the DTT-active components. The PM2.5 mass concentration is more related to exposure levels than intrinsic properties of components, while OP is determined by the components rather than PM2.5 mass concentration.

  abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a class of substances that are of general concern in terms of human health and are used to represent the oxidation potential (OP) of the atmosphere. In this study, the ROS levels in 116 daily fine particulate matter (PM2.5) samples taken over Xi'an in 2017 were measured with the dithiothreitol (DTT) method. The sources of DTTv (volume-based DTT consumption) in PM2.5 as well as their contributions were identified by both positive matrix factorization (PMF) and multiple linear regression (MLR) based on the measured chemical species in particulate matter (PM). The results showed that the yearly average DTTv over Xi'an was 0.53 nmol/min/m3 (0.19–1.10 nmol/min/m3). The highest DTTv level occurred in winter, followed by spring, summer and autumn. DTTv was the most strongly correlated with the water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC; r = 0.85), but the effects of WSOC on DTTv were very limited. SO2, NO2, CO, elemental carbon (EC) and K+ (r {$>$} 0.64) had moderate correlations with DTTv and were moderately related to environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) (r = 0.56). The linear mixed-effects model showed that pollutants originating from incomplete combustion had greater effects on DTTv than those from complete combustion. Source apportionment results from PMF showed that motor vehicle emissions (27.4\%), secondary sulfates (21.6\%) and coal combustion sources (18.8\%) were more important contributors to the DTTv in PM2.5 than dust sources (8.4\%), metal processing (4.9\%), industrial emissions (11.3\%) and secondary nitrates (7.5\%). The PMF results for the DTTv were consistent with the MLR results, which verified that both PMF and MLR are feasible methods for source apportionment of PM2.5 as well as specific species such as ROS and EPFRs. Backward trajectory clusters showed that the dominant cluster groups were local and regional transport, while the OP of the PM2.5 over Xi'an was affected more by long-range transport than by local transport. As stated above, the improvement of atmospheric oxidation potential require not only regional efforts but also large-scale joint cooperation. Furthermore, this study on the OP of PM as well as the specific source information provides important guidance for health effect research.},

  abstract = {Brown carbon (BrC) constitutes a large fraction of organic carbon and exhibits strong light absorption properties, thus affecting the global radiation budget. In this study, we investigated the light absorption properties, chemical functional bonds, and sources of BrC in six megacities in China, namely Beijing, Harbin, Xi'an, Chengdu, Guangzhou, and Wuhan. The average values of the BrC light absorption coefficient and the mass absorption efficiency at 365gnm in northern cities were higher than those in southern cities by 2.5 and 1.8 times, respectively, demonstrating the abundance of BrC present in northern China's megacities. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra revealed sharp and intense peaks at 1640, 1458-1385, and 1090-1030gcm-1, which were ascribed to aromatic phenols, confirming the contribution of primary emission sources (e.g., biomass burning and coal combustion) to BrC. In addition, we noted peaks at 860, 1280-1260, and 1640gcm-1, which were attributed to organonitrate and oxygenated phenolic groups, indicating that secondary BrC also existed in the six megacities. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) coupled with multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network analysis was used to apportion the sources of BrC light absorption. The results showed that primary emissions (e.g., biomass burning, tailpipe emissions, and coal combustion) made a major contribution to BrC in the six megacities. However, secondary formation processes made a greater contribution to light absorption in the southern cities (17.9g\%-21.2g\%) than in the northern cities (2.1g\%-10.2g\%). These results can provide a basis for the more effective control of BrC to reduce its impacts on regional climates and human health.},

In an effort to study the organic compounds contributing to smoke particulate matter impacting downwind communities, three co-located PM2.5 cyclones collected 24-h samples during significant smoke events in Missoula. Filter samples were then analyzed at two independent laboratories to quantify the concentrations of several chemical markers of wood smoke generated under natural combustion conditions, as well as to provide an intercomparison study of analytical methods (HPLC and GC/MS) used in the determination of levoglucosan concentrations.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, risk assessment has become increasingly relied upon for helping to make environmental management decisions. This trend has been accompanied by research and refinements in basic risk assessment methodologies to improve our ability to understand and evaluate the human health risks associated with chemical exposures. Despite this progress, significant uncertainties continue to be associated with the risk assessment process. These uncertainties typically derive from gaps in available data regarding chemical toxicity, and from difficulties in reliably estimating the magnitude of chemical exposures. Given these limitations, risk assessment is generally most valuable in evaluating relative risk; for example, when comparing alternatives to achieving a specified goal, setting priorities for protecting human health, or establishing procedures for properly allocating resources. Risk assessment can also be useful for developing regulatory benchmarks such as permit limits for air or water. In many cases, however, the limitations of the risk assessment process make it difficult (if not impossible) to reliably estimate an absolute level of risk, especially for a specific individual in an exposed population. In such cases, risk assessment can be seriously misapplied, and its results misinterpreted. This paper discusses some of the challenges that have been faced by the field of risk assessment during the 1990s. Current trends in risk assessment, and its use by regulatory agencies in making risk management decisions, are also described. © 1998 by ASP.},

  abstract = {Receptor models infer contributions from particulate matter (PM) source types using multivariate measurements of particle chemical and physical properties. Receptor models complement source models that estimate concentrations from emissions inventories and transport meteorology. Enrichment factor, chemical mass balance, multiple linear regression , eigenvector, edge detection, neural network, aerosol evolution, and aerosol equilibrium models have all been used to solve particulate air quality problems, and more than 500 citations of their theory and application document these uses. While elements, ions, and carbons were often used to apportion TSP, PM 10 , and PM 2:5 among many source types, many of these components have been reduced in source emissions such that more complex measurements of carbon fractions, specific organic compounds, single particle characteristics, and isotopic abundances now need to be measured in source and receptor samples. Compliance monitoring networks are not usually designed to obtain data for the observables, locations, and time periods that allow receptor models to be applied. Measurements from existing networks can be used to form conceptual models that allow the needed monitoring network to be optimized. The framework for using receptor models to solve air quality problems consists of: (1) formulating a conceptual model; (2) identifying potential sources; (3) characterizing source emissions; (4) obtaining and analyzing ambient PM samples for major components and source markers; (5) confirming source types with multivariate receptor models; (6) quantifying source contributions with the chemical mass balance; (7) estimating profile changes and the limiting precursor gases for secondary aerosols; and (8) reconciling receptor modeling results with source models, emissions inventories, and receptor data analyses.

UNMIX, positive matrix factorization (PMF), and effective variance are different solutions to the chemical mass balance (CMB) receptor model equations and are implemented on available software. In their more general form, the CMB equations allow spatial, temporal, transport, and particle size profiles to be combined with chemical source profiles for improved source resolution. Although UNMIX and PMF do not use source profiles explicitly as input data, they still require measured profiles to justify their derived source factors. The U.S. Supersites Program provided advanced datasets to apply these CMB solutions in different urban areas. Still lacking are better characterization of source emissions, new methods to estimate profile changes between source and receptor, and systematic sensitivity tests of deviations from receptor model assumptions.},

The oxidative potential (OP) of PM appears to be a more relevant proxy of the health impact of the aerosol rather than the total mass concentration. However, the relative contributions of the aerosol sources to the OP are still poorly known. In order to better quantify the impact of different PM sources, we sampled aerosols in a French city for one year (2014, 115 samples). A coupled analysis with detailed chemical speciation (more than 100 species, including organic and carbonaceous compounds, ions, metals and aethalometer measurements) and two OP assays (ascorbic acid, AA, and dithiothreitiol, DTT) in a simulated lung fluid (SLF) were performed in these samples. We present in this study a statistical framework using a coupled approach with positive matrix factorization (PMF) and multiple linear regression to attribute a redox-activity to PM sources. Our results highlight the importance of the biomass burning and vehicular sources to explain the observed OP for both assays. In general, we see a different contribution of the sources when considering the OP AA, OP DTT or the mass of the PM10. Moreover, significant differences are observed between the DTT and AA tests which emphasized chemical specificities of the two tests and the need of a standardized approach for the future studies on epidemiology or toxicology of the PM.},

In this context, the SOURCES project has been set-up to gather and investigate in a harmonized way 15 datasets of chemical compounds from PM10 collected for PMF studies during a five-year period (2012–2016) in France. The present paper aims at giving an overview of the results obtained within this project, notably illustrating the behavior of key primary sources as well as focusing on their statistical robustness and representativeness. Overall, wood burning for residential heating as well as road transport were confirmed to be the two main primary sources strongly influencing PM10 loadings across the country. While wood burning profiles, as well as those dominated by secondary inorganic aerosols, present a rather good homogeneity among the sites investigated, some significant variabilities were observed for primary traffic factors, illustrating the need to better characterize the diversity of the various vehicle exhaust and non-exhaust emissions. Finally, natural sources, such as sea salts (widely observed in internal mixing with anthropogenic compounds), primary biogenic aerosols and/or terrigenous particles, were also found as non-negligible PM10 components at every investigated site.},

The oxidative potential (OP) of PM, displaying the ability of PM to oxidize the lung environment, is gaining strong interest in examining health risks associated with PM exposure. In this study, OP was measured by two different acellular assays (dithiothreitol, DTT, and ascorbic acid, AA) on PM10 filter samples from 15 yearly time series of filters collected at 14 different locations in France between 2013 and 2018, including urban, traffic and Alpine valley site typologies. A detailed chemical speciation was also performed on the same samples, allowing the source apportionment of PM using positive matrix factorization (PMF) for each series, for a total number of more than 1700 samples. This study then provides a large-scale synthesis of the source apportionment of OP using coupled PMF and multiple linear regression (MLR) models. The primary road traffic, biomass burning, dust, MSA-rich, and primary biogenic sources had distinct positive redox activity towards the OPDTT assay, whereas biomass burning and road traffic sources only display significant activity for the OPAA assay. The daily median source contribution to the total OPDTT highlighted the dominant influence of the primary road traffic source. Both the biomass burning and the road traffic sources contributed evenly to the observed OPAA. Therefore, it appears clear that residential wood burning and road traffic are the two main target sources to be prioritized in order to decrease significantly the OP in western Europe and, if the OP is a good proxy of human health impact, to lower the health risks from PM exposure.},

In this study, we evaluated multiple measures of PM2.5 oxidative potential across Toronto, Canada (2016−2017), including glutathione/ascorbate-related oxidative potential (OPGSH and OPAA) and dithiothreitol depletion (OPDTT). Integrated 2-week samples were collected from 67 sites in summer and 42 sites in winter. Multivariable linear models were developed to predict OP based on various land use/traffic factors, and PM2.5 metals and black carbon were also examined. All three measures of PM2.5 oxidative potential varied substantially across Toronto. OPAA and OPDTT were primarily associated with traffic-related components of PM2.5 (i.e., Fe, Cu, and black carbon) whereas OPGSH was not a strong marker for traffic during either season. During summer, multivariable models performed best for OPAA (RCV2 = 0.48) followed by OPDTT (RCV2 = 0.32) and OPGSH (RCV2 = 0.22). During winter, model performance was best for OPDTT (RCV2 = 0.55) followed by OPGSH (RCV2 = 0.50) and OPAA (RCV2 = 0.23). Model parameters varied between seasons, and between-season differences in PM2.5 mass concentrations were weakly/moderately correlated with seasonal differences in OP. Our findings highlight substantial within-city variations in PM2.5 oxidative potential. More detailed information is needed on local sources of air pollution to improve model performance.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy bynhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Under stable nighttime conditions with low background winds, the pseudovertical profiles from all three lines were good proxies for free air temperature soundings over the basin center, with a mean nighttime cold temperature bias of about 0.4°C and a standard deviation of 0.4°C. Cold biases were highest in the upper basin where relatively warm air subsides to replace air that spills out of the basin through the lowest-altitude saddle. On a windy night, standard deviations increased to 1°-2°C. After sunrise, the varying exposures of the dataloggers to sunlight made the pseudovertical profiles less useful as proxies for free air soundings. The good correspondence between sidewall and free air temperatures during high-static-stability conditions suggests that sidewall soundings can be used to monitor temperatures, temperature gradients, and temperature inversion evolution in the sinkhole. Sidewall soundings can produce more frequent profiles at lower cost than can tethersondes or rawinsondes, and extension of these findings to other enclosed or semienclosed topographies may enhance future basic meteorological research or support applications studies in agriculture, forestry, air pollution, and land use planning. © 2004 American Meteorological Society.}

This article has gone on to be viewed more than 275,000 times (as of August 2013), and it is one of the first results displayed in a Google search for "regression assumptions". While Osborne and Waters' efforts in raising awareness of the need to check assumptions when using regression are laudable, we note that the original article contained at least two fairly important misconceptions about the assumptions of multiple regression: Firstly, that multiple regression requires the assumption of normally distributed variables; and secondly, that measurement errors necessarily cause underestimation of simple regression coefficients. In this article, we clarify that multiple regression models estimated using ordinary least squares require the assumption of normally distributed errors in order for trustworthy inferences, at least in small samples, but not the assumption of normally distributed response or predictor variables. Secondly, we point out that regression coefficients in simple regression models will be biased (toward zero) estimates of the relationships between variables of interest when measurement error is uncorrelated across those variables, but that when correlated measurement error is present, regression coefficients may be either upwardly or downwardly biased. We conclude with a brief corrected summary of the assumptions of multiple regression when using ordinary least squares.},

We used data from natural history collections to run the models, and evaluated the quality of model predictions with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). With decreasing sample size, model accuracy decreased and variability increased across species and between models. Novel modelling methods that incorporate both interactions between predictor variables and complex response shapes (i.e. GBM, MARS-INT, BRUTO) performed better than most methods at large sample sizes but not at the smallest sample sizes. Other algorithms were much less sensitive to sample size, including an algorithm based on maximum entropy (MAXENT) that had among the best predictive power across all sample sizes. Relative to other algorithms, a distance metric algorithm (DOMAIN) and a genetic algorithm (OM-GARP) had intermediate performance at the largest sample size and among the best performance at the lowest sample size. No algorithm predicted consistently well with small sample size (n {$<$} 30) and this should encourage highly conservative use of predictions based on small sample size and restrict their use to exploratory modelling. © 2008 The Authors.},

  abstract = {Coarse particulate matter (i.e. PM with an aerodynamic diameter between 2.5 and 10 µm – PM2.5 and PM10 – or PMcoarse) has been increasingly recognized for its importance in PM10 regulation because of its growing proportion in PM10 and the accumulative evidence for its adverse health impact. In this work, we present comprehensive PMcoarse speciation results obtained through a 1-year-long (January 2020–February 2021) joint PM10 and PM2.5 chemical speciation study in Hong Kong, a coastal and highly urbanized city in southern China. The annual average concentration of PMcoarse is 14.9 ± 8.6 µg m−3 (± standard deviation), accounting for 45 \% of PM10 (32.9 ± 18.5 µg m−3). The measured chemical components explain ∼ 75 \% of the PMcoarse mass. The unexplained part is contributed by unmeasured geological components and residue liquid water content, supported through analyses by positive matrix factorization (PMF) and the thermodynamic equilibrium model ISORROPIA II. The PMcoarse mass is apportioned to four sources resolved by PMF, namely soil dust/industrial and coal combustion, construction dust/copper-rich emissions, fresh sea salt, and an aged sea salt factor containing secondary inorganic aerosols (mostly nitrate). The PMcoarse concentration and source composition exhibit a distinct seasonal variation, a result mainly driven by the source areas the air masses have travelled through as revealed by back-trajectory analysis. In summer when the site is dominated by marine air mass, PMcoarse is the lowest (average = 8.1 µg m−3) and sea salt the largest contributor (47 \%), followed by the two dust factors (36 \% in total). In winter when the site receives air mass mainly from the northern continental region, PMcoarse concentration triples (24.8 µg m−3), with the two dust factors contributing three quarters of the aerosol mass. The potential dust source areas are mapped using the concentration-weighted trajectory technique, showing either the Greater Bay Area or the greater part of southern China as the origin of fugitive dust emissions leading to elevated ambient PMcoarse loadings in Hong Kong. This study, the first of this kind in our region, provides highly relevant guidance for other locations with similar monitoring needs. Additionally, the study findings point to the need for further research on the sources, transport, aerosol processes, and health effects of PMcoarse.},

  abstract = {40 The adverse health effects associated with ambient aerosol particles have been well documented, but it is still unclear which aerosol properties are most important for their negative health impact. Some studies suggest the oxidative effects of particle-bound reactive oxygen species (ROS) are potential major contributors to the toxicity of particles. Traditional ROS measurement techniques are labour intense, give poor temporal resolution, and generally have significant delays between aerosol sampling and ROS analysis. However, many oxidizing particle components are reactive and thus potentially short-45 lived. Thus, a technique to quantify particle-bound ROS online would be beneficial to quantify also the short-lived ROS components. We introduce a new portable instrument to allow on-line, continuous measurement of particle-bound ROS using a chemical assay of 2'7'-dichlorofluorescein (DCFH) with horseradish peroxidase (HRP), via fluorescence spectroscopy. All 50 components of the new instrument are attached to a containing shell, resulting in a compact system capable of automated continuous field deployment over many hours to days. From laboratory measurements, the instrument was found to have a detection limit of 4 nmol[H 2 O 2 ]equivalents per m 3 air, a dynamic range up to at least 2000 nmol[H 2 O 2 ]equivalents per m 3 air, and a time resolution under 12 minutes. The 55 instrument allows for 12 hours automated measurement if unattended, and shows a fast response to changes in concentrations of laboratory-generated oxidised organic aerosol. The instrument was deployed at an urban site in London and particulate ROS levels of up to 24 nmol[H 2 O 2 ]equivalents per m 3 air were detected with PM 2.5 concentrations up to 28 µg m-3. 60 The new and portable On-line Particle-bound ROS Instrument (OPROSI) allows fast-response quantification; this is important due to the potentially short-lived nature of particle-bound ROS as well as fast changing atmospheric conditions, especially in urban environments. The instrument design allows for automated operation and extended field operation. As well as having sensitivity suitable for ambient level measurement, the instrument is also suitable at concentrations such as those required for toxicological studies. 65},

  abstract = {In recent years, Mainland China, and in particular the industrial hotbed of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) has experienced an increasingly serious problem of high concentrations of airborne particulate matter. Following the tightening-up of China’s air quality policies in recent years, and with especially fine particles now added to a new air quality objective, the identification of major source regions and major types of pollutants has become crucial. In this study, the Comprehensive Air Quality Model (CAMx), together with the Particulate Source Apportionment Technology (PSAT) source apportionment method, has been applied to analyze how different emission activities influence PM concentration in the PRD region. By using this method, a detailed source region and emission category contribution matrix is derived for all regions within the Hong Kong/PRD region and source appointment results show that, on average, for different cities super-regional transport and mobile vehicles are the two major fine particle sources, contributing 62\% (34.3 mg m3) and 21\% (12.2 mg m3) of the total figure in December, and 42\% (13.1 mg m3) and 28\% (9.7 mg m3) in April. Meanwhile, over the same period in Hong Kong, in addition to these two factors, marine proved another very significant source of particle pollutant, amounting to 18\% of the total figure (4.7 mg m3). Another important cause of high PM levels has been the transport of fine particles between cities within the PRD region, with three different regions selected for detailed analysis. Results show that for the Hong Kong/PRD region local reduction of mobile sources and collaboration between different areas could have succeeded in alleviating the air pollution problem.},

  abstract = {When discussing the association between birth weight and air pollution, previous studies mainly focus on the maternal trimester-specific exposures during pregnancy, whereas the possible associations between birth weight and weekly-specific exposures have been largely neglected. We conducted a nested 1:4 matched case-control study in Jinan, China to examine the weekly-specific associations during pregnancy between maternal fine particulate matter (aerodynamic diameter {$<$} 2.5 𝜇m, PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) exposure and birth weight, which is under a representative scenario of very high pollution levels. Ambient air monitoring data from thirteen monitoring stations and daily mean temperature data for Jinan during 2013–2016 were continuously collected. Birth data were obtained from the largest maternity and child care hospital of this city during 2014–2016. Individual exposures to PM2.5, NO2, and SO2 during pregnancy were estimated using an inverse distance weighting method. Birth weight for gender-, gestational age-, and parity-specific standard score (BWGAP z-score) was calculated as the outcome of interest. Distributed lag non-linear models (DLNMs) were applied to estimate weekly-specific relationship between maternal air pollutant exposures and birth weight. For an increase of per inter-quartile range in maternal PM2.5 exposure concentration during pregnancy, the BWGAP z-score decreased significantly during the 27th–33th gestational weeks with the strongest association in the 30th gestational weeks (standard deviation units decrease in BWGAP z-score: −0.049, 95\% CI: −0.080 −0.017, in three-pollutant model). No significant association between maternal weekly NO2 or SO2 BWGAP z-score was observed. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that maternal PM2.5 exposure during the 27th–33th gestational weeks may reduce the birth weight in the context of very high pollution level of PM2.5.},

The light absorption ability of HULIS in winter is 2-3 times higher than that in summer. In winter, HULIS are mainly derived from biomass burning emissions in South Asia by long-range transport. In contrast, the oxidation of anthropogenic and biogenic precursors from northeast part of India and southeast of TP are major sources of HULIS in summer.},

  abstract = {Week-long samples of airborne particulate matter were obtained at Alert, Northwest Territories, Canada, between 1980 and 1991. The concentrations of 24 particulate constituents have some strong, persistent seasonal variations that depend on the transport from their sources. In order to explore the nature of the cyclical variation of the different processes that give rise to the measured concentrations, the observations were arranged into both a two-way matrix and a three-way data array. For the latter, the three modes consist of chemical constituents, weeks within a year, and years. The two-way bilinear model and a three-way trilinear model were used to fit the data and a new data analysis technique, positive matrix factorization (PMF), has been used to obtain the solutions. PMF utilizes the error estimates of the observations to provide an optimal pointwise scaling data array for weighting, which enables it to handle missing data, a common occurrence in environmental measurements. It can also apply nonnegative constraints to the factors. Five factors have been obtained that reproduce the data quite well for both two-way and three-way analyses. Each factor represents a probable source with a compositional profile and distinctive seasonal variations. Specifically, there are (i) an acid photochemical factor typified by Br2, H1, and and characterized by a concentration maximum around April, or shortly after polar sunrise; 22 SO4 (ii) a soil factor representing by Si, Al, and Ca and having its main seasonal maximum in September and October; (iii) an anthropogenic factor dominated by together with metallic species like Pb, Zn, V, As, Sb, Se, In, 22 SO4 etc., peaking from December to April; (iv) a sea salt factor consisting mainly of Cl, Na, and K with maximum concentrations during the period from October to April; and (v) a biogenic factor characterized by methanesulfonate and having a primary maximum at May and a secondary maximum in August. The results obtained by both two-way and three-way PMF analyses are generally consistent with one another. However, there are differences because of additional constraints on the solution imposed by the three-way analysis. The results also help to confirm the hypotheses regarding the origins of the Arctic aerosol.},

To understand the mechanism of ROS generation, we tested several redox-active substances, such as 9,10-phenanthrenequinone (PQ), 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (5H-1,4NQ), 1,2-naphthoquinone (1,2-NQ), 1,4-naphthoquinone (1,4-NQ), copper(II), manganese(II), and iron (II and III). Both pure compounds and their mixtures show different patterns in DTT oxidation versus ROS generation. The quinones, known to oxidize DTT in the efficiency order of PQ {$>$} 5H-1,4NQ {$>$} 1,2-NQ {$>$} 1,4-NQ, show a different efficiency order (5H-1,4NQ {$>$} 1,2-NQ ≈ PQ {$>$} 1,4-NQ) in the ROS generation. Cu(II), a dominant metal in DTT oxidation, contributes almost negligibly to the ROS generation. Fe is mostly inactive in DTT oxidation, but shows synergistic effect in •OH formation in the presence of other quinones (mixture/sum {$>$} 1.5). Ten ambient PM samples collected from an urban site were analyzed, and although DTT oxidation was significantly correlated with H2O2 generation (Pearson's r = 0.91), no correlation was observed between DTT oxidation and •OH formation. Our results show that measuring both DTT consumption and ROS generation in the DTT assay is important to incorporate the synergistic contribution from different aerosol components and to provide a more inclusive picture of the ROS activity of ambient PM.}

These data were collected as part of the APHH-Beijing (Atmospheric Pollution and Human Health in a Chinese Megacity) field observation campaigns from 10               th               November to 12               th               December in winter 2016 and from 22               nd               May to 24               th               June in summer 2017.               14               C analysis revealed the predominant contribution of fossil fuel combustion to carbonaceous aerosols in winter compared with non-fossil fuel sources, which is supported by the results from other methods. An extended Gelencsér (EG) method incorporating               14               C data, as well as the CMB and AMS/ACSM-PMF methods, generated a consistent source apportionment for fossil fuel related primary organic carbon. Coal combustion, traffic and biomass burning POC were comparable for CMB and AMS/ACSM-PMF. There are uncertainties in the EG method when estimating biomass burning and cooking OC. The POC from cooking estimated by different methods was poorly correlated, suggesting a large uncertainty when differentiating this source type. The PM               2.5               source apportionment results varied between different methods. Through a comparison and correlation analysis of CMB, PMF and AMS/ACSM-PMF, the CMB method appears to give the most complete and representative source apportionment of Beijing aerosols.

  abstract = {Fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5) is a leading contributor to the overall global burden of disease. Traditionally, outdoor PM2.5 has been characterized using mass concentrations which treat all particles as equally harmful. Oxidative potential (OP) (per μg) and oxidative burden (OB) (per m3) are complementary metrics that estimate the ability of PM2.5 to cause oxidative stress, which is an important mechanism in air pollution health effects. Here, we provide the first national estimates of spatial variations in multiple measures (glutathione, ascorbate, and dithiothreitol depletion) of annual median outdoor PM2.5 OB across Canada. To do this, we combined a large database of ground-level OB measurements collected monthly prospectively across Canada for 2 years (2016−2018) with PM2.5 components estimated using a chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) and satellite aerosol observations. Our predicted ground-level OB values of all three methods were consistent with ground-level observations (cross-validation R2 = 0.63−0.74). We found that forested regions and urban areas had the highest OB, predicted primarily by black carbon and organic carbon from wildfires and transportation sources. Importantly, the dominant components associated with OB were different than those contributing to PM2.5 mass concentrations (secondary inorganic aerosol); thus, OB metrics may better indicate harmful components and sources on health than the bulk PM2.5 mass, reinforcing that OB estimates can complement the existing PM2.5 data in future national-level epidemiological studies.},

Currently, this process heavily relies on human experience, resulting in high subjectivity in the results and requiring a time-consuming procedure. In this study, a pseudo label extra trees classifier model was proposed to facilitate the automated identification of factor profiles. The source profiles serve as domain knowledge to train the model, as they accurately reflect the distinctive characteristics of emission sources. The findings indicate that the recognition rate of seven factors is 94.3\%, significantly outperforming four factors (25\%), five factors (30\%), six factors (60\%). Significantly, the model demonstrates its proficiency in determining the optimal number of factors. And the factor profiles identified using this approach demonstrate complete concurrence with manual recognition. For offline datasets, the model is also proficient at identifying factor profiles and exhibits excellent generalization. This approach facilitates the identification of emission sources in intricate environments and advances the model’s capacity to automatically discern source categories by utilizing domain knowledge characteristics.},

Emission regulations for diesel exhaust intended to reduce EC concentrations have been strengthened in recent years. To investigate regulation effects in Japan, daily EC concentrations in the megacity of Nagoya, central Japan, were measured during April 2003–March 2016. The EC concentrations showed a decreasing trend with changing seasonal variation: high concentrations were found in autumn and winter before 2011, but no seasonal variation was discernible after 2012. Strong correlation was found for annual vehicular EC emissions and annual mean EC concentrations during 2003–2009. However, the relation after 2010 was weaker in spring and summer. Based on the relation of EC with trace element (Pb, V, Sb, etc.) concentrations and the backward air trajectories on high concentration days, EC sources other than vehicles were found to be related to long-range transport of air pollution from China in spring and combustion of heavy oil, including ship engine exhaust, in summer.},

  abstract = {The capacity of Particulate Matter (PM) to oxidise target molecules, defined as its oxidative potential (OP), has been proposed as a biologically more relevant metric than PM mass. Different assays exist for measuring OP and their methodologies vary in the choice of extraction solvent and filter type. Little is known about the impact of extraction and filter type on reported OP. Four a-cellular assays; electron spin resonance (ESR), dithiothreitol (DTT), ascorbate acid depletion (AA) and reductive acridinium triggering (CRAT) assay were chosen to evaluate whether these differences affect the OP measurement, the correlation between OP from different assays and the association with PM chemical composition. We analysed 15 urban 48-72h PM2.5 samples collected on quartz and Teflon filters. The choice of extraction solvent had only a significant effect on OPDTT, while all OP measures for quartz filters were heavily attenuated. OP values derived from quartz were, however, highly correlated with those derived from Teflon. OPDTT correlated highly with OPCRAT, and OPESR correlated highly with OPAA. These correlations were affected by the choice of filter type. Correlations between OP and PM chemical composition were not affected by filter type and extraction solvent. These findings indicate that the measurement of relative OP reactivity is not greatly influenced by filter type and extraction solvent for the investigated assays. This robustness is also promising for exploratory use in monitoring and subsequent epidemiological studies. © 2013 The Authors.},

  abstract = {Introduction The oxidative potential (OP) of particulate matter (PM) has been proposed as a healthrelevant metric, but currently few epidemiological studies investigated associations of OP with health. Our main aim was to assess associations of long-term exposure to OP with respiratory health in children. Our second aim was to evaluate whether OP is more consistently associated with respiratory health than PM mass, PM composition or nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Methods For 3701 participants of a prospective birth cohort, annual average concentrations of OP (assessed by spin resonance (OPESR) and dithiothreitol assay (OPDTT)), PM with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 mm (PM2.5) mass, NO2, and PM2.5 constituents at the home addresses at birth and at all follow-up addresses were estimated by land-use regression. Repeated questionnaire reports of asthma and hay fever until age 14 years, and measurements of allergic sensitisation, lung function and fractional exhaled nitric oxide at age 12 years were linked with air pollution concentrations. Results Asthma incidence, prevalence of asthma symptoms and rhinitis were positively associated with OPDTT (adjusted OR (95\% CI) per IQR increase in exposure 1.10 (1.01 to 1.20), 1.08 (1.02 to 1.16), 1.15 (1.05 to 1.26), respectively). These associations persisted after adjustment for most co-pollutants. Forced expiratory volume in 1s and forced vital capacity were negatively associated with OPDTT. These associations were sensitive to adjustment for NO2. Respiratory health was not significantly associated with PM2.5 mass and OPESR. Conclusions Respiratory health was more strongly associated with OPDTT than with PM2.5 mass; OPDTT associations with lung function, but not symptoms, were sensitive to adjustment for NO2.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in epidemiology have confirmed that airborne particulates are directly associated with respiratory pathology and mortality. Although clinical studies have yielded evidence of the effects of many types of fine particulates on human health, it still does not have a complete understanding of how physiological reactions are caused nor to the changes and damages associated with cellular and molecular mechanisms. Currently, most health assessment studies of particulate matter (PM) are conducted through cell culture or animal experiments. The results of such experiments often do not correlate with clinical findings or actual human reactions, and they also cause difficulty when investigating the causes of air pollution and associated human health hazards, the analysis of biomarkers, and the development of future pollution control strategies. Microfluidic-based cell culture technology has considerable potential to expand the capabilities of conventional cell culture by providing high-precision measurement, considerably increasing the potential for the parallelization of cellular assays, ensuring inexpensive automation, and improving the response of the overall cell culture in a more physiologically relevant context. This review paper focuses on integrating the important respiratory health problems caused by air pollution today, as well as the development and application of biomimetic organ-on-a-chip technology. This more precise experimental model is expected to accelerate studies elucidating the effect of PM on the human body and to reveal new opportunities for breakthroughs in disease research and drug development.},

Outdoor OPM (mass-normalized OP characterizes toxicity) and OPV (volume-based OP characterizes overall oxidative burden) in Nanjing were at a medium level compared to results reported for twenty-seven cities. Although PM2.5 mass concentration consistently decreased during outdoor-to-indoor transport, OPM varied by a factor of up to 2 in either direction, indicating a change of PM2.5’s ability to disrupt oxidative-reductive balance.

We developed an improved PMF method (termed ICLP-PMF) that estimated the reaction-corrected (“initial”) concentrations of VOCs. Source profiles from literature provided constraints. ICLP-PMF evaluated the vehicular emission contributions to hourly speciated VOC data from December 2020 to March 2021 and estimated gasoline and diesel vehicles contributions to Tianjin's VOC concentrations around the Chinese Spring Festival (SF). The average observed and initial total VOCs (TVOCs) concentrations were 24.2 and 42.9 ppbv, respectively. Alkanes were the highest concentration VOCs while aromatics showed the largest photochemical losses during the study period. Literature gasoline and diesel profiles from representative Chinese cities were constructed and provided constraints. Source apportionment was performed using ICLP-PMF method and three other PMF approaches. Photochemical losses of alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons induced differences between calculated factor profiles and literature profiles. Using observed concentrations and unconstrained profiles produced underestimated SF contributions (∼121\% and 72\% for gasoline and diesel vehicles, respectively). According to the ICLP-PMF results, the contributions of gasoline and diesel vehicles during the SF were 25.6\% and 23.2\%, respectively, lower than those before and after the SF. No diel diesel vehicle contribution variations were found during the SF likely due to the decline in truck activity north of the study site during the holiday period.},

Source analyses of such high time-resolved concentrations provides key information for controlling VOC emissions. This work reviewed the literature on VOCs source analyses published from 2015 to 2021, and assesses the state-of-the-art and the existing issues with these studies. Gas chromatography system and direct-inlet mass spectrometry are the main monitoring tools. Quality control (QC) of the monitoring process is critical prior to analysis. QC includes inspection and replacement of instrument consumables, calibration curve corrections, and reviewing the data. Approximately 54\% published papers lacked details on the quantitative evaluation of the effectiveness of QC measures. Among the reviewed works, the number of monitored species varied from 5 to 119, and fraction of papers with more than 90 monitored species increased yearly. US EPA PMF v5.0 was the most commonly used (∼86\%) for VOC source analyses. However, conventional source apportionment directly uses the measured VOCs and may be problematic given the impacts of dispersion and photochemical losses, uncertainty setting of VOCs data, factor resolution, and factor identification. Excluding species with high-reactivity or estimation of corrected concentrations were often applied to reduce the influence of photochemical reactions on the results. However, most reports did not specify the selection criteria or the specific error fraction values in the uncertainty estimation. Model diagnostic indexes were used in 99\% of the reports for PMF analysis to determine the factor resolution. Due to lack of known local source profiles, factor identification was mainly achieved using marker species and characteristic species ratios. However, multiple sources had high-collinearity and the same species were often used to identify different sources. Vehicle emissions and fuel evaporation were the primary contributors to VOCs around the world. Contribution of coal combustion in China was substantially higher than in other countries.},

  abstract = {Sugars and sugar-alcohols are demonstrated to be important constituents of the ambient aerosol water-soluble organic carbon fraction, and to be tracers for primary biological aerosol particles (PBAP). In the present study, levels of four sugars (fructose, glucose, sucrose, trehalose) and three sugar-alcohols (arabitol, inositol, mannitol) in ambient aerosols have been quantified using a novel HPLC/HRMS-TOF (High Performance Liquid Chromatography in combination with High Resolution Mass Spectrometry-Time of Flight) method to assess the contribution of PBAP to PM 10 and PM 2.5. Samples were collected at four sites in Norway at different times of the year in order to reflect the various contributing sources and the spatial and seasonal variation of the selected compounds. Sugars and sugar-alcohols were present at all sites investigated , underlining the ubiquity of these highly polar organic compounds. The highest concentrations were reported for sucrose, reaching a maximum concentration of 320 ng m −3 in PM 10 and 55 ng m −3 in PM 2.5. The mean concentration of sucrose was up to 10 times higher than fructose, glucose and the dimeric sugar trehalose. The mean concentrations of the sugar-alcohols were typically lower, or equal, to that of the monomeric sugars and trehalose. Peak concentrations of arabitol and mannitol did not exceed 30 ng m −3 in PM 10 , and for PM 2.5 all concentrations were below 6 ng m −3. Sugars and sugar-alcohols were associated primarily with coarse aerosols except during wintertime at the suburban site in Elverum, where a shift towards sub micron aerosols was observed. It is proposed that this shift was due to the intensive use of wood burning for residential heating at this site during winter, confirmed by high concurrent concentrations of levoglucosan. Elevated concentrations of sugars in PM 2.5 were observed during spring and early summer at the rural background site Birkenes. It is hypothesized that this was due to ruptured pollen.},

The OC=EC (2001-2018) and the levoglucosan (2008-2018) time series are the longest in Europe, with OC=EC available for the PM10, PM2:5 (fine), and PM10-2:5 (coarse) size fractions, providing the opportunity for a nearly 2-decade-long assessment. Using positive matrix factorization (PMF), we identify seven carbonaceous aerosol sources at Birkenes: mineraldust- dominated aerosol (MIN), traffic/industry-like aerosol (TRA/IND), short-range-transported biogenic secondary organic aerosol (BSOASRT), primary biological aerosol particles (PBAP), biomass burning aerosol (BB), ammoniumnitrate- dominated aerosol (NH4NO3), and (one low carbon fraction) sea salt aerosol (SS). We observed significant (p {$<$} 0:05), large decreases in EC in PM10 (-3:9\%yr-1) and PM2:5 (-4:2\%yr-1) and a smaller decline in levoglucosan (-2:8\%yr-1), suggesting that OC=EC from traffic and industry is decreasing, whereas the abatement of OC=EC from biomass burning has been slightly less successful. EC abatement with respect to anthropogenic sources is further supported by decreasing EC fractions in PM2:5 (-3:9\%yr-1) and PM10 (-4:5\%yr-1). PMF apportioned 72\% of EC to fossil fuel sources; this was further supported by PMF applied to absorption photometer data, which yielded a two-factor solution with a low aerosol ngstr m exponent (AAED0.93) fraction, assumed to be equivalent black carbon from fossil fuel combustion (eBCFF), contributing 78\% to eBC mass. The higher AAE fraction (AAED2.04) is likely eBC from BB (eBCBB). Source-receptor model calculations (FLEXPART) showed that continental Europe and western Russia were the main source regions of both elevated eBCBB and eBCFF. Dominating biogenic sources explain why there was no downward trend for OC. A relative increase in the OC fraction in PM2:5 (C3:2\%yr-1) and PM10 (C2:4\%yr-1) underscores the importance of biogenic sources at Birkenes (BSOA and PBAP), which were higher in the vegetative season and dominated both fine (53 \%) and coarse (78 \%) OC. Furthermore, 77 \%-91\% of OC in PM2:5, PM10-2:5, and PM10 was attributed to biogenic sources in summer vs. 22 \%- 37\% in winter. The coarse fraction had the highest share of biogenic sources regardless of season and was dominated by PBAP, except in winter. Our results show a shift in the aerosol composition at Birkenes and, thus, also in the relative source contributions. The need for diverse offline and online carbonaceous aerosol speciation to understand carbonaceous aerosol sources, including their seasonal, annual, and long-term variability, has been demonstrated.},

Nineteen water-soluble organic acids in 12-h PM 1 , PM 2.5 and PM 10 samples collected in urban Beijing during haze episodes in winter and spring of 2017 were identified to investigate their characteristics and secondary formation mechanism. The molecular distributions of water-soluble organic acids as well as the high ratio of phthalic acid (Ph)/azelaic acid (C 9 ) indicated severe aromatic secondary organic aerosol pollution during the haze episodes, especially in winter. The diurnal patterns, size distributions, and concentration ratios of specific organic acids were investigated to reveal the pollution characteristics and possible sources of major organic acids in particulate matter in Beijing during haze events. Multiple linear regression was used to tentatively quantify the relative contributions of photochemical oxidation and aqueous-phase oxidation to the formation of total water-soluble organic acids in PM 1 , PM 2.5 and PM 10 during haze episodes. The formation mechanism of sulfate and nitrate was also investigated for comparison. Different from the secondary formation of sulfate, the secondary formation of water-soluble organic acids showed enhanced contribution of gas-phase photochemical oxidation though the aqueous-phase oxidation was the dominant process. Capsule: Molecular analyses of organic acids in PM 1 , PM 2.5 and PM 10 in Beijing during haze periods revealed their pollution characteristics, possible sources and formation mechanism.},

  abstract = {Elemental concentrations of ambient aerosols are commonly sampled over 12e24 h, and the low time resolution puts a great limit on current understanding about the temporal variations and source apportionment based on receptor models. In this work, hourly-resolved concentrations of eighteen elements in PM2.5 at an urban site in Nanjing, a megacity in Yangtze River Delta of east China, were obtained by using a Xact 625 ambient metals monitor from 12/12/2016 to 12/31/2017. The influence of traffic activities was clearly reflected by the spikes of crustal elements (e.g., Fe, Ca, and Si) in the morning rush hour, and the firework burning and sandstorm events during the sampling periods were tracked by sharp enrichment of Ba, K and Fe, Ca, Si, Ti in PM2.5, respectively. To evaluate the advantage of hourlyresolved elements data in identifying impacts from specific emission sources, positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis was performed with the 1-h data set (PMF1-h) and 23-h averaged data (PMF23-h), respectively. The 4- and 6-factor PMF23-h solutions had similar factor profiles and consistent factor contributions as the corresponding PMF1-h solutions. However, due to the limit in inter-sample variability, PMF analysis with 23-h average data misclassified some major (e.g., K, Fe, Zn, Ca, and Si) and trace (e.g., Pb) elements in factor profiles, resulting in different absolute factor contributions between PMF23-h and PMF1-h solutions. These results suggested the use of high time-resolved data to obtain valid and robust source apportionment results.},

A large set of PM2.5 samples (N\,=\,241) were collected from five sites, setup in different environments, i.e. urban, rural and roadside, in Illinois, Indiana and Missouri during May 2018–May 2019. Five acellular OP endpoints, including the consumption rate of ascorbic acid and glutathione in a surrogate lung fluid (SLF) (OPAA and OPGSH, respectively), dithiothreitol (DTT) depletion rate (OPDTT), and ·OH generation rate in SLF and DTT (OPOH-SLF and OPOH-DTT, respectively), were measured for all PM2.5 samples. PM2.5 mass concentrations in the Midwest US as obtained from these samples were spatially homogeneously distributed, while most OP endpoints showed significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Seasonally, higher activities occurred in summer for most OP endpoints for both water- and methanol-soluble extracts. Spatially, roadside site showed highest activities for most OP endpoints in the water-soluble extracts, while only occasional peaks were observed at urban sites in the methanol-soluble OP. Most OP endpoints showed similar spatiotemporal trends between mass- and volume-normalized activities across different sites and seasons. Comparisons between two solvents (i.e. water and methanol) showed that methanol-soluble OP generally had higher activity levels than corresponding water-soluble OP. Site-to-site comparisons of OP showed stronger correlations for methanol-soluble OP compared to water-soluble OP, indicating a better extraction of water-insoluble redox-active compounds from various emission sources into methanol. We found a weak correlation and inconsistent slope values between PM2.5 mass and most OP endpoints. Moreover, the poor-to-moderate intercorrelations among different OP endpoints infer different mechanisms of OP represented by these endpoints, and thus demonstrate the rationale for analyzing multiple acellular endpoints for a better and comprehensive assessment of OP.},

  abstract = {The ecological and environmental science communities have embraced machine learning (ML) for empirical modelling and prediction. However, going beyond prediction to draw insights into underlying functional relationships between response variables and environmental ‘drivers’ is less straightforward. Deriving ecological insights from fitted ML models requires techniques to extract the ‘learning’ hidden in the ML models. We revisit the theoretical background and effectiveness of four approaches for deriving insights from ML: ranking independent variable importance (Gini importance, GI; permutation importance, PI; split importance, SI; and conditional permutation importance, CPI), and two approaches for inference of bivariate functional relationships (partial dependence plots, PDP; and accumulated local effect plots, ALE). We also explore the use of a surrogate model for visualization and interpretation of complex multi-variate relationships between response variables and environmental drivers. We examine the challenges and opportunities for extracting ecological insights with these interpretation approaches. Specifically, we aim to improve interpretation of ML models by investigating how effectiveness relates to (a) interpretation algorithm, (b) sample size and (c) the presence of spurious explanatory variables. We base the analysis on simulations with known underlying functional relationships between response and predictor variables, with added white noise and the presence of correlated but non-influential variables. The results indicate that deriving ecological insight is strongly affected by interpretation algorithm and spurious variables, and moderately impacted by sample size. Removing spurious variables improves interpretation of ML models. Meanwhile, increasing sample size has limited value in the presence of spurious variables, but increasing sample size does improves performance once spurious variables are omitted. Among the four ranking methods, SI is slightly more effective than the other methods in the presence of spurious variables, while GI and SI yield higher accuracy when spurious variables are removed. PDP is more effective in retrieving underlying functional relationships than ALE, but its reliability declines sharply in the presence of spurious variables. Visualization and interpretation of the interactive effects of predictors and the response variable can be enhanced using surrogate models, including three-dimensional visualizations and use of loess planes to represent independent variable effects and interactions. Machine learning analysts should be aware that including correlated independent variables in ML models with no clear causal relationship to response variables can interfere with ecological inference. When ecological inference is important, ML models should be constructed with independent variables that have clear causal effects on response variables. While interpreting ML models for ecological inference remains challenging, we show that careful choice of interpretation methods, exclusion of spurious variables and adequate sample size can provide more and better opportunities to ‘learn from machine learning’.},

The secondary reaction products arising from reactive Criegee intermediates are mainly peroxidic, notably secondary ozonides and α-acyloxyalkyl hydroperoxide oligomers and polymers, and their formation is in accord with solution and liquidphase ozonolysis. These highly oxygenated products are of low volatility and hydrophilic which may enhance the ability of particles to act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). The kinetic description of this HRS is critically reviewed. Most kinetic studies suggest this oxidative processing is either a near surface reaction that is limited by the diffusion of ozone or a surface based reaction. Internally mixed particles and coatings represent the next stage in the progression towards more realistic proxies of tropospheric organic aerosols and a description of the products and the kinetics resulting from the ozonolysis of these proxies, which are based on fatty acids or their derivatives, is presented. Finally, the main atmospheric implications of oxidative processing of particulate containing fatty acids are presented. These implications include the extended lifetime of unsaturated species in the troposphere facilitated by the presence of solids, semi-solids or viscous phases, and an enhanced rate of ozone uptake by particulate unsaturates compared to corresponding gas-phase organics.},

  abstract = {Monthly average ambient concentrations of more than eighty particle-phase organic compounds, as well as total organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC), were measured from March 2004 through February 2005 in five cities in the Midwestern United States. A multi-variant source apportionment receptor model, positive matrix factorization (PMF), was applied to explore the average source contributions to the five sampling sites using molecular markers for primary and secondary organic aerosols (POA, SOA). Using the molecular makers in the model, POA and SOA were estimated for each month at each site. Three POA factors were derived, which were dominated by primary molecular markers such as EC, hopanes, steranes, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and which represented the following POA sources: urban primary sources, mobile sources, and other combustion sources. The three POA sources accounted for 57\% of total average ambient OC. Three factors, characterized by the presence of reaction products of isoprene, a-pinene and b-caryophyllene, and displaying distinct seasonal trends, were consistent with the characteristics of SOA. The SOA factors made up 43\% of the total average measured OC. The PMF-derived results are in good agreement with estimated SOA concentrations obtained from SOA to tracer yield estimates obtained from smog chamber experiments. A linear regression comparing the smog chamber yield estimates and the PMF SOA contributions had a regression slope of 1.01  0.07 and an intercept of 0.19  0.10 mg OC m3 (adjusted R2 of 0.763, n ¼ 58).},

Based on over 900 filters that spanned all of 2007, levoglucosan and K+ were studied in conjunction with MODIS Aqua fire count data to compare their performances as biomass burning tracers. Levoglucosan concentrations exhibited a distinct seasonal variation with large enhancement in winter and spring and a minimum in summer, and were well correlated with fire counts, except in winter when residential wood burning contributions were significant. In contrast, K+ concentrations had no apparent seasonal trend and poor correlation with fire counts. Levoglucosan and K+ only correlated well in winter (r2 = 0.59) when biomass burning emissions were highest, whereas in other seasons they were not correlated due to the presence of other K+ sources. Levoglucosan also exhibited larger spatial variability than K+. Both species were higher in urban than rural sites (mean 44\% higher for levoglucosan and 86\% for K+). Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) was applied to analyze PM2.5 sources and four factors were resolved: biomass burning, refractory material, secondary light absorbing WSOC and secondary sulfate/WSOC. The biomass burning source contributed 13\% to PM2.5 mass annually, 27\% in winter, and less than 2\% in summer, consistent with other souce apportionment studies based on levoglucosan, but lower in summer compared to studies based on K+.},

Filter samples of fine and coarse air particulate matter (PM) collected over a period of one year in central Europe (Mainz, Germany) were analyzed for water-soluble organic compounds (WSOCs), including the α- and β-pinene oxidation products pinic acid, pinonic acid and 3-methyl-1,2,3-butanetricarboxylic acid (3-MBTCA), as well as a variety of dicarboxylic acids and nitrophenols. Seasonal variations and other characteristic features in fine, coarse, and total PM (TSP) are discussed with regard to aerosol sources and sinks in comparison to data from other studies and regions. The ratios of adipic acid and phthalic acid to azelaic acid indicate that the investigated aerosol samples were mainly influenced by biogenic sources. A strong Arrhenius-type correlation was found between the 3-MBTCA concentration and inverse temperature (R2 = 0.79, n = 52, Ea = 126 ± 10 kJ mol−1, temperature range 275–300 K). Model calculations suggest that the temperature dependence observed for 3-MBTCA can be explained by enhanced photochemical production due to an increase of hydroxyl radical (OH) concentration with increasing temperature, whereas the influence of gas-particle partitioning appears to play a minor role. The results indicate that the OH-initiated oxidation of pinonic acid is the rate-limiting step in the formation of 3-MBTCA, and that 3-MBTCA may be a suitable tracer for the chemical aging of biogenic secondary organic aerosol (SOA) by OH radicals. An Arrhenius-type temperature dependence was also observed for the concentration of pinic acid (R2 = 0.60, n = 56, Ea = 84 ± 9 kJ mol−1); it can be tentatively explained by the temperature dependence of biogenic pinene emission as the rate-limiting step of pinic acid formation.},

  abstract = {Abstract. In this study, 121 daily PM2.5 (aerosol particle with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm) samples were collected from an urban site in Beijing in four months between April 2009 and January 2010 representing the four seasons. The samples were determined for various compositions, including elements, ions, and organic/elemental carbon. Various approaches, such as chemical mass balance, positive matrix factorization (PMF), trajectory clustering, and potential source contribution function (PSCF), were employed for characterizing aerosol speciation, identifying likely sources, and apportioning contributions from each likely source. Our results have shown distinctive seasonality for various aerosol speciations associated with PM2.5 in Beijing. Soil dust waxes in the spring and wanes in the summer. Regarding the secondary aerosol components, inorganic and organic species may behave in different manners. The former preferentially forms in the hot and humid summer via photochemical reactions, although their precursor gases, such as SO2 and NOx, are emitted much more in winter. The latter seems to favorably form in the cold and dry winter. Synoptic meteorological and climate conditions can overwhelm the emission pattern in the formation of secondary aerosols. The PMF model identified six main sources: soil dust, coal combustion, biomass burning, traffic and waste incineration emission, industrial pollution, and secondary inorganic aerosol. Each of these sources has an annual mean contribution of 16, 14, 13, 3, 28, and 26\%, respectively, to PM2.5. However, the relative contributions of these identified sources significantly vary with changing seasons. The results of trajectory clustering and the PSCF method demonstrated that regional sources could be crucial contributors to PM pollution in Beijing. In conclusion, we have unraveled some complex aspects of the pollution sources and formation processes of PM2.5 in Beijing. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study that comprehensively explores the chemical characterizations and source apportionments of PM2.5 aerosol speciation in Beijing by applying multiple approaches based on a completely seasonal perspective.},

  abstract = {Exposure to ambient air pollution has been associated with greater risk of elevated blood pressure (BP) in adults and children. Recent evidence suggests that air pollution exposure in pregnancy may also portend increased risk for the next generation; however, few studies have examined this relationship. We conducted a prospective study of 1293 mothers in the Boston Birth Cohort (enrolled 1998–2012) and their children who had follow-up visits between 3 and 9 years of age and complete exposure and outcome data. Our primary exposure, ambient particulate matter ≤2.5 µm (PM               2.5               ) concentration during pregnancy, was estimated by matching mother’s residential address to the US Environmental Protection Agency’s air quality monitors. We defined our primary outcome child systolic BP (SBP) percentile according to US reference (Fourth Report) and classified elevated BP as SBP ≥90th percentile. Our multivariable-adjusted cubic spline showed a sharp increase in offspring SBP percentile and risk for elevated BP when third-trimester PM               2.5               concentration was ≥13 μg/m               3               . The highest versus lowest tertile of third-trimester PM               2.5               exposure was associated with a 4.85 (95\% confidence interval: 1.38–8.37) percentile increase in child SBP or a 1.61 (95\% confidence interval: 1.13–2.30) times higher risk of child elevated BP. A 5-μg/m               3               increment in PM               2.5               during the third trimester was associated with a 3.49 (95\% confidence interval: 0.71–6.26) percentile increase in child SBP or a 1.47 (95\% confidence interval: 1.17–1.85) times higher risk of elevated BP. Our findings suggest that exposure to ambient PM               2.5               during the third trimester of pregnancy is associated with elevated BP in children, ages 3 to 9 years.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Organic aerosol (OA) particles are recognized as key factors influencing air quality and climate change. However, highly time-resolved long-term characterizations of their composition and sources in ambient air are still very limited due to challenging continuous observations. Here, we present an analysis of long-term variability of submicron OA using the combination of an aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM) and a multiwavelength Aethalometer from November~2011 to March~2018 at a peri-urban background site of the Paris region (France). Source apportionment of OA was achieved via partially constrained positive matrix factorization (PMF) using the multilinear engine (ME-2). Two primary OA (POA) and two oxygenated OA (OOA) factors were identified and quantified over the entire studied period. POA factors were designated as hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA) and biomass burning OA (BBOA). The latter factor presented a significant seasonality with higher concentrations in winter with significant monthly contributions to OA (18\,\%–33\,\%) due to enhanced residential wood burning emissions. HOA mainly originated from traffic emissions but was also influenced by biomass burning in cold periods. OOA factors were distinguished between their less- and more-oxidized fractions (LO-OOA and MO-OOA, respectively). These factors presented distinct seasonal patterns, associated with different atmospheric formation pathways. A pronounced increase in LO-OOA concentrations and contributions (50\,\%–66\,\%) was observed in summer, which may be mainly explained by secondary OA (SOA) formation processes involving biogenic gaseous precursors. Conversely, high concentrations and OA contributions (32\,\%–62\,\%) of MO-OOA during winter and spring seasons were partly associated with anthropogenic emissions and/or long-range transport from northeastern Europe. The contribution of the different OA factors as a function of OA mass loading highlighted the dominant roles of POA during pollution episodes in fall and winter and of SOA for highest springtime and summertime OA concentrations. Finally, long-term trend analyses indicated a decreasing feature (of about −175\,ng\,m−3\,yr−1) for MO-OOA, very limited or insignificant decreasing trends for primary anthropogenic carbonaceous aerosols (BBOA and HOA, along with the fossil-fuel and biomass-burning black carbon components) and no statistically significant trend for LO-OOA over the 6-year investigated period.},

Moreover, an excellent correlation with levoglucosan (r2 = 0.9 and slope = 22.2 at 370 nm), suggesting important contribution of wood burning emissions to ambient BrC aerosols in France. At all sites, BrC peaks were mainly observed during late evening, linking to local intense residential wood burning during this time period. Furthermore, the geographic origin analysis also highlighted the high potential contribution of local and/or small-regional emissions to BrC. Focusing on the Paris region, twice higher BrC mass absorption efficiency value was obtained for less oxidized biomass burning organic aerosols (BBOA) compared to more oxidized BBOA (e.g., about 4.9 ± 0.2 vs. 2.0 ± 0.1 m2 g−1, respectively, at 370 nm). Finally, the BBOA direct radiative effect was found to be 40\% higher when these two BBOA fractions are treated as light-absorbing species, compared to the non-absorbing BBOA scenario.},

  abstract = {Metal components in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from nontailpipe emissions may play an important role in underlying the adverse respiratory effects of PM2.5. We investigated the associations between longterm exposure to iron (Fe) and copper (Cu) in PM2.5 and their combined impact on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in human lungs, and the incidence of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), COPD mortality, pneumonia mortality, and respiratory mortality. We conducted a population-based cohort study of ∼0.8 million adults in Toronto, Canada. Land-use regression models were used to estimate the concentrations of Fe, Cu, and ROS. Outcomes were ascertained using validated health administrative databases. We found positive associations between long-term exposure to Fe, Cu, and ROS and the risks of all five respiratory outcomes. The associations were more robust for COPD, pneumonia mortality, and respiratory mortality than for asthma incidence and COPD mortality. Stronger associations were observed for ROS than for either Fe or Cu. In two-pollutant models, adjustment for nitrogen dioxide somewhat attenuated the associations while adjustment for PM2.5 had little influence. Long-term exposure to Fe and Cu in PM2.5 and estimated ROS concentration in lung fluid was associated with increased incidence of respiratory diseases, suggesting the adverse respiratory effects of nontailpipe emissions.},

  abstract = {Source apportionment of PM2.5 in Lanzhou, China, was carried out using positive matrix factorization (PMF). Seventeen elements (Ca, Fe, K, Ti, Ba, Mn, Sr, Cd, Se, Pb, Cu, Zn, As, Ni, Co, Cr, V), water-soluble ions (Na+, NH4+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2, Cl−, NO3−, SO42−), and organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) were analyzed. The results indicated that the mean concentration of PM2.5 was 178.63 ± 96.99 µg/m3. In winter, the PM2.5 concentration was higher during the day than at night, and the opposite was the case in summer, and the nighttime PM2.5 concentration was 1.3 times higher than during the day. Water-soluble ions were the dominant component of PM2.5 during the study. PMF source analysis revealed six sources in winter, during the day and night: salt lakes, coal combustion, vehicle emissions, secondary aerosols, soil dust, and industrial emissions. In summer, eight sources during the day and night were identified: soil dust, coal combustion, industrial emissions, vehicle emissions, secondary sulfate, salt lakes, secondary aerosols, and biomass burning. Secondary aerosols, coal combustion, and vehicle emissions were the dominant sources of PM2.5. In winter, the proportions of secondary aerosols and soil dust sources were greater during the day than at night, and the opposite was the case in summer. The coal source, industrial emissions source, and motor vehicle emissions source were greater at night than during the day in winter.

The OP values of PM2.5 samples collected from the Xianlin were higher than those from the Gulou by using both the DTT assay and the AA assay in this study, suggesting the seasonal and spatial variation. Moreover, OP values analyzed by using DTT assay were higher than those by using AA assay. Based on Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF), the major pollution source of the OP of PM2.5 in Nanjing was combustion source.

In last decade, intensive field works have promoted development of quantification and analysis method, unearthed spatio-temporal variation, and proved evidence for source identification of HULIS. These important developments were summarized in this review to provide a global perspective of HULIS. The diverse operational HULIS definitions were gradually focused onto several versions. Although found globally in Europe, Asia, Australasia and North America, HULIS are far more typical in continental and near-ground aerosols. HULIS concentrations varied from {$<$}1 mg/m3 to {$>$}13 mg/m3, with their carbon fraction making up 9\%e72\% of water soluble organic carbon. Dominant HULIS source was suggested as secondary processes and biomass burning, with the detailed formation pathways suggested and verified in laboratory works.},

  abstract = {New monitoring technologies have now permitted the measurement of a variety of chemical species in airborne particulate matter with time resolution as high as 10 min to 1 h. There are still species that are measured with longer integration periods such as several hours to a day. These data from different measurement methods produce a data set of mixed time resolution. Traditional eigenvalue-based methods used in solving multivariate receptor models are unable to analyze this kind of data set since these data cannot form a simple matrix. Averaging the high time resolution data or interpolating the low time resolution data to produce data on the same time schedule is not acceptable. The former method loses valuable temporal information and the latter produces unreliable high resolution series because of the invalid assumption of temporal smoothness. In the present work, a solution to the problem of multiple sampling time intervals has been developed and tested. Each data value is used in its original time schedule without averaging or interpolation and the source contributions are averaged to the corresponding sampling interval. For data with the highest time resolution, the contributions are not actually averaged. The contribution series are smoothed by regularization auxiliary equations especially for sources containing very little high resolution species. This new model will be explored using data from the Pittsburgh supersite.},

  abstract = {Oxalic acid is one of the most abundant dicarboxylic acids in the atmosphere, receiving a great deal of attention due to its potential influence on cloud condensation nucleus activities. In this work, we report 10 months of hourly oxalate measurements in particulate matter of less than 2.5 µm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) by a Monitor for Aerosols and Gases in ambient Air at a suburban coastal site in Hong Kong from April 2012 to February 2013. A total of more than 6000 sets of oxalate and inorganic ion data were obtained. The mean (±SD) oxalate concentration was 0.34 (±0.18) µgm-3, accounting for 2.8\% of the total ion mass and 1.5\% of the PM2.5 mass. Seasonal variation showed higher concentrations in fall and winter (0.54 and 0.36 µgm-3, respectively) and lower concentrations in spring and summer (\textasciitilde 0.26 µgm-3). Different from the inorganic ions, a shallow dip in the oxalate concentration consistently occurred in the morning after sunrise (around 9:00 A.M.) throughout all seasons. Our analysis suggests that this was likely due to photolysis of oxalate-Fe (III) complex under sunlight. In summer, a small daytime peak was discernable for oxalate and nitrate. This characteristic, together with a more evident diurnal variation of O3, indicates comparatively more active photochemical oxidation in summer than other seasons. High correlations were observed between oxalate and non-sea-salt SO42- (NSS) (R2 = 0.63) and Ox (O3+NO2) (R2 = 0.48), indicating significant commonality in their secondary formation. Positive matrix factorization analysis of oxalate and other real-time gas and particle-phase component data estimates that secondary formation processes, including secondary gas or aqueous oxidation processes (49\%), oxidation processes of biomass burning emissions (37\%), accounted for the majority of PM2.5 oxalate. A backward trajectories cluster analysis found that higher oxalate/NSS ratios were associated with low pollution samples under the influence of marine air masses while the ratios were lower in high pollution samples that were typically associated with continental airmasses passing through areas of high anthropogenic emissions. Isolating the “low pollution marine” aerosols across the entire data set indicates that oxalate production increased in the summer compared to other seasons, suggesting either more active marine emissions of oxalate precursors or stronger photochemical processes in the summer.},

  abstract = {© 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers. Ground settlements above a tunnel as a result of tunnel construction can be predicted with the help of input variables that hav e direct physical significance. Several empirical and artificial intelligence methods for estimating ground settlements have been established by researchers. However, these methods have some limitations because the large number of influential factors involved makes tunnel-ground interaction complicated. In this work, a random forest (RF) was developed and employed to predict ground settlements above tunnels. To achieve this goal, tunnel geometry, geological properties, and construction parameters were investigated as input variables to utilize in the RF modeling, resulting in the maximum surface settlement value (S max ) and trough width (i) as the ground surface settlement index. To demonstrate the applicability of the RF model, two data sets associated with different features, which were obtained from a detailed investigation of different tunnel projects published in literature, were utilized for model development and were applied to check the performance capacity of the developed model. A fivefold cross-validation procedure was then applied to identify the optimal parameter values during modeling, and an external testing set was employed to validate the prediction performance of the model. Two performance measures, R 2 and RMS error, were employed. The relative importance of different parameters in the prediction of ground settlements was also investigated. Findings demonstrate that the RF method provides promising results and offers an alternative means in predicting ground settlements induced by tunneling.}

Aerosol samples were collected at Cape Hedo, Okinawa Island, Japan, from October 2009 to February 2012 and analyzed for five primary saccharides and four sugar alcohols as PBAP tracers. We detected high levels of sucrose in spring when blossoming of plants happens and prolifically emits pollen to the air. Concentrations of glucose, fructose, and trehalose showed levels higher than the other saccharides in spring in 2010. In comparison, primary saccharide levels were mutually comparable in spring, summer, and autumn in 2011, indicating the interannual variability of their local production in subtropical forests, which is driven by local temperature and radiation. High trehalose events were found to be associated with Asian dust outflows, indicating that Asian dust also contributes to PBAPs at Okinawa. Sugar alcohols peaked in summer and correlated with local precipitation and temperature, indicating high microbial activities. Positive matrix factorization analysis confirmed that the PBAPs are mainly derived fromlocal vegetation, pollen, and fungal spores. A higher contribution of PBAP tracers to water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) was found in summer (14.9\%). The annual mean ambient loadings of fungal spores and PBAPs were estimated as 0.49 μgm-3and 4.12 μgm-3, respectively, using the tracer method. We report, for the first time, year-round biomarkers of PBAP and soil dust and their contributions to WSOC in the subtropical outflow region of the Asian continent.},

For this reason, this study addressed the potential impacts in a Chinese megacity affected by non-ferrous metal mines, and explored the characteristics and health risks of HMs in PM2.5 during summer, autumn, and winter from June 2019 to January 2020. The results showed that the average PM2.5 concentration and total concentration of 10 associated HMs increased from 25.5 to 48.5 μg m 3 and from 51.5 to 133 ng m 3, respectively, from summer to winter. Combining methods for health risk assessment of elements and sources, we found that the total carcinogenic risk (CR) of six carcinogenic HMs (As, Cr, Co, Cd, Ni, and Pb) also exhibited a clear increasing trend from summer to winter. However, the total CR (1.12 × 10 5) in summer still exceeded the minimum acceptable risk level. The main contributors to CR in each of the three seasons were consistently industrial emissions and coal combustion, with their combined contributions exceeding 82.5\%. Further analysis indicated that in all three seasons, the CR of industrial emissions mainly resulted from Cr, Co, and Cd, while the CR of coal combustion was primarily due to As, highlighting the significant challenges of controlling Cr-, Co-, and Cd-related industries and As emissions from combustion in areas affected by non-ferrous metal mines in the future.},

After the chemical analyses on carbonaceous species, water-soluble ions and inorganic elements, various approaches, such as Mann-Kendall test, chemical mass closure, ISORROPIA II model, Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) linked with Potential Source Contribution Function (PSCF), were used to explore the PM2.5 speciation, sources, and source regions. Consequently, distinct seasonal variations of PM2.5 and its main species were found and could be explained by varying emission source characteristics. Based on PMF model, seven source factors for PM2.5 were identified, which were coal combustion + biomass burning, vehicle emission, mineral dust, ship emission, sea salt, industry source, refined chrome industry with the contribution of 48.21\%, 30.33\%, 7.24\%, 6.63\%, 3.51\%, 3.2\%, and 0.88\%, respectively. In addition, PSCF analysis using the daily contribution of each factor from PMF result suggested that Shandong peninsula and Hebei province were identified as the high potential region for coal combustion + biomass burning; Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region was the main source region for industry source; Bohai Sea and East China Sea were found to be of high source potential for ship emission; Geographical region located northwest of BH Island was possessed of high probability for sea salt; Mineral dust presumably came from the region of Mongolia; Refined chrome industry mostly came from Liaoning, Jilin province; The vehicle emission was primarily of BTH region origin, centring on metropolises, such as Beijing and Tianjin. These results provided precious implications for PM2.5 control strategies in North China.},
