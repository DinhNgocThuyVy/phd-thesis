\noindent This thesis examines the application of Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) for source apportionment of atmospheric pollution. We develop advanced optimization techniques and validation frameworks that enhance the accuracy and reliability of PMF in identifying pollution sources across European urban environments.

Our research demonstrates that improved model configuration and validation protocols can significantly reduce uncertainties in source contribution estimates, providing policy makers with more reliable data for targeted interventions.
