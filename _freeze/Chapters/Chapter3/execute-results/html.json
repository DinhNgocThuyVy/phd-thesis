Through illustrative case studies from various European urban environments, it demonstrates how robust PMF findings can inform targeted and effective pollution control strategies. The chapter also proposes a structured framework for translating complex scientific outputs into actionable policy recommendations, considering aspects such as cost-benefit analysis, stakeholder engagement, and realistic implementation timelines for proposed interventions.\n:::\n\nUnder review at Environmental Science & Policy\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis chapter examines how PMF source apportionment results can be effectively integrated into air quality policy development. We present case studies from multiple European cities and develop a framework for translating scientific findings into actionable policy recommendations.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Policy Impact Framework\n\n::: {#tbl-impact-framework .cell cache='true' tbl-cap='Framework for evaluating source-specific interventions' execution_count=1}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display .cell-output-markdown}\n| Source    |   Contribution (%) | Control Options   | Implementation Cost   | Health Impact   | Stakeholder Support   |\n|:----------|-------------------:|:------------------|:----------------------|:----------------|:----------------------|\n| Traffic   |                 35 | LEZ               | High                  | High            | High                  |\n| Industry  |                 25 | BAT               | Very High             | Medium          | Medium                |\n| Biomass   |                 20 | Regulation        | Medium                | High            | High                  |\n| Secondary |                 20 | Regional          | High                  | Medium          | Medium                |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Cost-Benefit Analysis\n\n::: {#cell-fig-cost-benefit .cell cache='true' fig-height='6' execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Cost-benefit analysis of source control measures](Chapter3_files/figure-html/fig-cost-benefit-output-1.png){#fig-cost-benefit}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Implementation Timeline\n\n::: {#cell-fig-timeline .cell cache='true' fig-height='4' execution_count=3}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Implementation timeline for source control measures](Chapter3_files/figure-html/fig-timeline-output-1.png){#fig-timeline}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Policy Recommendations\n\nBased on our analysis of PMF results and stakeholder input, we recommend:\n\n1. Short-term (1-2 years):\n   - Implementation of Low Emission Zones\n   - Enhanced industrial emissions monitoring\n   \n2. Medium-term (2-4 years):\n   - Biomass burning regulations\n   - Regional cooperation frameworks\n\n3. Long-term (4+ years):\n   - Integrated air quality management system\n   - Cross-border pollution control measures\n\n",
